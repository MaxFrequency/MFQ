[Civil War Trailer](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cA4wVhs3HC0) from A24

Abby and I went and saw this Friday night and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. We went in only seeing the above trailer and knowing that Kirsten Dunst starred in the film. It's this perfect amalgamation of Max interests; wartime journalism, stunning cinematography, killer acting, and a punchy message. You pay for the whole seat, but only need the edge. I cannot recommend this one enough.
