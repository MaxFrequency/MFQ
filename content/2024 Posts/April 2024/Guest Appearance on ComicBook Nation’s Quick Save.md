[Our Hopes for the Invincible Video Game (ComicBook Nation’s Quick Save)](https://www.youtube.com/live/w5n3nu7OLks) by Logan Moore for Comicbook.com

I had the pleasure of joining my friend and long time co-host Logan Moore on *his* podcast over at Comcibook.com *Quick Save*. We chatted all about the news that Skybound is developing a AAA *Invincible* game in house and are raising investment funds. 

Logan got me into *Invincible* six years ago, after probably that many years of recommending it. I was hooked and haven't stopped singing the praises of the series. And during all this time, Logan and I have pondered what an *Invincible* game would look like. Now the game is in some form of development and we got to speculate about its possibilities. 

Thanks again to Logan and Comicbook.com. I hope you enjoy the show.

> “I think that’d be cool is all I can say right now.”

	1. Acquisitions in creative development and publishing
	2. Support the growth of bourgeoning in-house animation studio
	3. Strategic hires

Fighting Game duh

Examples
*Dragon Ball FighterZ*
*Power Rangers?*

*2XKO*

Fighting games have potential for long tails, competition/tournaments, lots of eyes. 

2D or 3D?

1v1, 2v2, 3v3, tag fighter, 3D spaces (Tekken), over the shoulder (a la budokai), platform fighter? 😬
