It's been a week since [[Delta Emulator is on the App Store|Delta officially released on the App Store.]] Since then, it has been the number one app worldwide, out performing the likes of *Temu*, *Threads*, and *TikTok*.[^1] It's like John Voorhees [threaded](https://www.threads.net/@johnvoorhees/post/C55vTQkL9ie)(?)[^2] out

> This is what pent up demand looks like.

And with all the pent up demand, plenty of folks are looking for ways to load their games and saves onto their iPhone. I've seen lots of articles ([like John's!](https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-to-load-your-game-boy-games-onto-the-iphone-to-play-in-the-delta-emulator/)) and plenty of recommended YouTube videos explaining options and exploring Delta. It's interesting to see the excitement and algorithm work in real time like that, all while sitting back and thinking "I knew about this ages ago."

To quiet my inner-hipster a bit, this is exciting. There is a joy in folks rediscovering games from their childhood with so little friction. Just download a free, good app, load a game, and play. They don't have to wade into the seas of the retro market and its tsunami-sized prices. They don't have to use a device they don't want to. It's their favorite and most accessible piece of tech. 

So I wanted compile a resource that explores all the available consoles in Delta. Most stuff I've seen just explores one console: Delta features seven at this particular launch. There are plenty of tools and options that run the price gamut for getting your games and save data off the cartridge and onto the phone. I've spent years [[Preserving and Rediscovering My Game Collection|preserving my games and their data]]. Backing up my saves in particular is something I feel passionate about.
# You Wouldn't Steal a Car

[You wouldn't, right](https://youtube.com/watch?v=P-pYiWGSN8w)? Piracy is a crime, but let's cut to the chase and just say it: Odds are, you fine folks are just searching for the game you want and throwing the words "rom" or "download" on the end. I can't stop you. 

All I will do is recommend/advise you be careful about where you download stuff from. Use good Internet common sense. 

The real point of this post isn't to explain how to just download someone else's ROM of a game though; it is how to get *your* save data and rom. The save is the personal piece in gaming. If you are fortunate enough to still have your game collection, then these are the real bits you want to save. The ROM just so happens to usually be accessible in this methodology too. And I like having the knowledge my digital copy is from my physical copy. It makes me feel good.

One likely exception to all this is the Nintendo DS BIOS files, which the odds are you fine folks really aren't going to dump off your hacked Nintendo DS you have lying around. Think of the BIOS as the operating system of the console, the [Windows XP to the DS](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QsSWdQHENBQ). I'm sure you can find a copy.
# The One Device Fits All Solution

Before going console by console, I'm just going to address the one device that can tackle all of Delta's consoles, except the DS. It's not the cheapest, but it is my favorite—the [Open Source Cartridge Reader](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader).

This sucker is a dream machine that folks can build themselves or buy from a builder that will backup and dump all your games from the NES[^3], SNES, N64, Game Boy family, Genesis, and Master System. The price ranges from $125-250, depending on who you buy it from.

I bought a V3 model from [Save the Hero Builders](https://savethehero.builders) for a little over $150. I have wanted a solution for my N64 collection for years. The rest of these consoles were icing on the cake considering I had other solutions for them. This device is a dream come true with its all-in-one, standalone design. No extra software required. You just need an SD card reader to get the files onto your computer or iPhone. If you have a large, diverse game collection and the money, buy one of these and call it a day. You can see it in action in Macho Nacho Production's excellent [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=k_aNSev7Y0M).
# The Game Boy Family

I wager the Game Boy is the most popular console folks are looking to play in Delta. Over 200 million Game Boy consoles were sold and who knows how many games. It's the home for most of the *Pokémon* games, which is the world's highest grossing media franchise. The Game Boy is hot stuff, even all these years later.

With that hotness, there are plenty of options for backing up your games and saves. The easiest, most accessible way these days is probably the [GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator), which I [[GB Operator Thoughts and Impressions|reviewed]] back in the day and is what John Voorhees [wrote](https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-to-load-your-game-boy-games-onto-the-iphone-to-play-in-the-delta-emulator/) about above.

For a cool $50, you get this slick little cartridge reader that plugs into your computer via USB-C. Plop in your cartridge and use their [Playback](https://www.epilogue.co/downloads) software to dump, backup, and even play your games. This is how I closed my own thoughts and impressions on the device: 

> "The GB Operator is sleek, simple, and versatile. Even with beta software, the future of both the GB Operator and Epilogue is bright. For the enthusiast, it is an affordable tool for preservation, development, and emulation. For the lapsed fan that found a box of old games in their parent’s attic, it is a window to their past with modern accessibility. Epilogue has struck that balance beautifully. There is power in its elegance. The GB Operator truly is a 'cartridge slot for your computer.'"

In the near three years since I wrote that, the Playback software has left beta and has some neat features. I am confident in recommending the GB Operator to you. Plus, Epilogue is [working on an adapter for the Super Nintendo](https://twitter.com/meet_epilogue/status/1767166127497453992).

So what about other options? One you *might* have lying around is a GameCube with a Game Boy Player. With a little [homebrew software and patience](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_tVJYdZRAXg&t=1898), you can dump the games. I [[Preserving and Rediscovering My Game Collection#Brewing Solutions|did this]] back when I was too impatient to wait for something like the GB Operator or an Analogue Pocket.

Speaking of which, if you'd bought an [[Launch Analogue Pocket Thoughts & Impressions|Analogue Pocket]], then you can backup save data/save state. The Pocket's ability to backup saves is very much just a side benefit to the consoles main attraction of playing the games on a killer screen with FPGA tech, just like the other Analogue consoles, which are no longer for sale because Analogue refuses to maintain production. 
# Nintendo's Home Cartridge Scene

When I was brainstorming this piece, I thought there'd be more options for the NES, SNES, and N64 given their legacy. In my prep and research, it seems that a lot of options have fallen out of production or to the wayside because of time, money, interest, or the Open Source Cartridge Reader.

There was the [Retrode 2](https://stoneagegamer.com/retrode-2.html), but it does not seem to be in stock and requires adapters for N64 and Game Boy / Color. After considering the cost to buy all that off eBay, plus the fact there is no support for NES or GBA, you might as well buy an Open Source Cartridge Reader. 

One option I considered before the OSCR, was the [Retro Blaster](https://retrostage.net/?product=retroblaster-mini-programmer-dumper). This product is in production and is designed for programming and dumping games. You do need to [buy adapters](https://retrostage.net/?product=retroblaster-mini-cartridge-adapters), but it could be a slightly cheaper option than the OSCR, if you only want two or three consoles.
# Dual Screens? Dual Methods.

The Nintendo DS is *the* system to be playing on Delta. I [[Delta 1.3 Thoughts & Impressions|said as much]] three years ago:

> "The best system to emulate in Delta has to be the Nintendo DS. With touch being an integral part of the DS, the iPhone makes for a perfect emulation device. The DS screens are close and [[delta_ds_pm_pink.png|look wonderful]] on an iPhone with the gorgeous layout designed by Riley. Touch just makes sense."

And there are plenty of options for using the consoles on hand to back up your games. If you've got a DS lying around, you can [extract the BIOS with a flash cart](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/ds-index/ds-bios-firmware-dump?tab=flashcard). These are super cheap these days, and [a new one](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EGlt-3ipQCM) just hit the scene. As for the games, you can [buy a USB dongle](https://www.r43ds.org/products/Neo-SMS-4-.html). I haven't tried one of these and the product page only indicates Windows support, but if you *only* have a DS or DS Lite, then this is an affordable option.

If you have a DSi or a 3DS, you have the hardware you need thanks to the built-in SD card slots. All you have to add is a little homebrew software. I've never run homebrew on a DSi, but the [steps](https://dsi.cfw.guide) seem simple.

The 3DS is where it's at these days with portable Nintendo homebrewed goodness. The [3DS setup](https://3ds.hacks.guide) is easy. The guide will walk you through everything and help you install the applications I use to backup saves and games—[Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint) and [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9). Checkpoint in particular has been essential in backing up my game saves and restoring them.
# Virtual Console Saves

Perhaps you no longer have the physical games, but you do still have a Wii or Wii U lying around with plenty of games and saves from the Virtual Console. The Wii VC is fairly easy. I learned from My Life in Gaming that you just need to have the game and its data on the SD card and then convert the data.bin file. Try goes over it in detail in their [excellent video on save preservation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=_tVJYdZRAXg&t=874).

The Wii U is a bit trickier, requiring homebrew like the 3DS. I totally [[Hot, Fresh Homebrewed Consoles#Wii U and Tiramisu|recommend]] doing this anyway, since you can do all sorts of cool stuff like scale DS games properly. Here's the [guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/introduction) for Wii U homebrew.[^4] You'll need the homebrew app SaveMii to [move files](https://www.reddit.com/r/WiiUHacks/comments/ute2vr/wii_u_vc_ds_save_to_ds_save/) around. I've done this to bring my DS saves to the Wii U, but never the other way around. 

If you are going to these lengths to get your save data, I imagine you are comfortable with following a guide, watching tutorials, etc. At least, I hope so!

# PSP

> [!info]- Update (5/31/2024):
> In light of the PSP emulators hitting the iOS scene, I thought it'd be time to learn how to dump my own PSP collection. It's so easy that I decided to add the process here.

I have a very tiny PSP collection and sort of assumed that the [UMD-based format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Media_Disc) of games would make dumping them tedious. My assumption could not have been further from the truth! All you need is your PSP, a little custom firmware, the game, and a [[HelloDarkness.gif|USB mini cable]].

First up you need to install some good ol' fashioned homebrew custom firmware on your PSP. I followed [the guide from PSPunk](https://www.pspunk.com/psp-cfw/). It took less than five minutes.

Download the [latest firmware](https://github.com/PSP-Archive/ARK-4) and extract the zip file. Plug your PSP into your computer and put the PSP in its USB Connection mode, which is near the top of the settings menu. Then move the folder called `ARK_01234` into the `/PSP/SAVEDATA/` folder on the console and move the `ARK_Loader` folder to the `/PSP/GAME/` folder. Disconnect the PSP from your computer and then run the "game" *ARK Loader* under the game menu. The install happens in a flash and you are all set. 

There are some more steps you can follow to permanently install the custom firmware, which I did, but you can follow those steps easily at PSPunk.

Now, insert your game of choice into the PSP's UMD drive and navigate to the game in the PSP menu. Push the "Select" button to make a special little firmware menu pop up. Go to the "Advanced Menu" and change the "USB Device" to "UMD." This will turn your PSP from a USB device for the Memory Stick Duo into a USB disc drive for the UMD. Put your PSP into its USB Connection mode again and on your computer you will now see a drive that houses the .ISO of the game. Drag to your computer and enjoy!

As for your save data, those you can access by putting the PSP in its normal/default USB mode and navigating to that `SAVEDATA` folder we saw earlier. The folder names are a jumble of letters and numbers, but you can easily identify the game with the image file saved there.[^5]

Man, I miss how easy moving stuff to and from the PSP was. It really was a plug and play media device that had no fuss, despite the proprietary memory card. I guess that also explains [how](https://youtu.be/qIxKPu20R58?si=KJB2CBWpakPHRkjf) the PSP was so quickly and easily [hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable_homebrew).
# So What do You Do with all These Saves?

You have all these saves files in a plethora of formats. What do you do now?

You might need to convert them. Thankfully, converting saves is much easier these days. [Save File Converter](https://savefileconverter.com/) is your friend. Pick the format you have and click convert! Some consoles, you may notice, are missing. For example, where is Game Boy? Those you just need to change the file extension to ".sav" Super easy. I do wish there was wider support for N64 save conversion. I'm still struggling to find a way to get these saves into an emulator.

> [!info]+ Update (5/2/2024):
> The creator of Save File Converter, Euan Forrester, emailed me and gave me some help and insight! Euan is considering a generic .srm to .sav converter, which directly addresses my Game Boy question.
> 
> As for N64—and I do not know why I didn't think of this before—simply use the flash cartridge to raw/emulator options to convert the save off the cartridge. A flash cart would/should produce accurate save files, so it's sort of the same there. This conversion to raw/emulator is "like the baseline for save files" according to Euan. I ran a test with my *Super Smash Bros.* save and the data immediately loaded in Delta, preserving data over 25 years old that was tied to a battery.

# Getting the Data to Delta

That's the goal, right?! Getting files on the iPhone is a lot easier these days than [back in my day](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wvwbKfS44Fo). Apple outlines four categories of options on their [support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/transfer-files-between-devices-iphf2d851b9/ios),
- Wirelessly with AirDrop
- iCloud
- External Storage, servers, or service (Dropbox)
- A good ol' fashioned cable

With the files on your phone, all you need to do is open Delta, press the + button in the upper corner and navigate to the ROM's location. Delta will plop the ROM in the console category that is applicable. To load your save, just long press on the game and select "Import Save File," repeating the process of navigating, but this time to the save file's location. Tap the game afterward and you will be all set!

Delta also supports a syncing option by using Dropbox or Google Drive as the backbone, if you have multiple iOS devices that you want all your games and saves to migrate between. 

---
You've done it! You've successfully backed up your own physical games and their saves. You are no longer at the whim of dying batteries or sketchy Google searches. You've preserved and backed up *your* game. There's something about that fact that brings me great joy and I hope it does the same for you. Go forth and enjoy your old games on your fancy iPhone.
