I've made some design changes. I know the new version is only 10ish days old, but I wanted to share these particular ones. I promise this won't become a frequent thing.

First up, if you haven't explored the [[Colophon]], you may have missed the [[Changelog]] link. This little page is home to all major revisions to the site and its design. Check it out whenever you want to see what has changed.

There is also now a [[Theme Testing]] page. There you will find all possible formats, styles, callouts, etc. that I have implemented on the site. Go there, toggle the light and dark modes to see all possibilities of Max Frequency visually. There is also a link to the site's current CSS file there, should you be curious. 

From now on, if something is tweaked or changed, you'll find the specifics on the changelog. I'll bank these notes up as I go along to make changelog entries less frequent. Should anything major be altered, I'll probably whip up a proper post for that. 

Until next time, I hope you enjoy!
