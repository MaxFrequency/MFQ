[Marvel Animation's X-Men '97 | Official Trailer](https://youtube.com/watch?v=pv3Ss8o9gGQ)

Another absolute banger in Hollywood right now is *X-Men '97*. This show is a primo example of nostalgia and legacy done right. [Everyone is here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EXnbMp1yr1k). Marvel has been on a major downswing since *No Way Home*. This is easily the best work they've done in years. And yes, the fifth episode is immaculate. I cannot wait to watch the back half of this first season.
