"[Phil Spencer on what the hell is happening in the games industry](https://www.polygon.com/24108700/phil-spencer-interview-2024-xbox-exclusives-layoffs)" by Chris Plante for Polygon via [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-multiplatform-brand-pivot-partly-driven-by-gen-z-habits/)

> “This notion that Xbox can only be this one device that plugs into a television isn’t something we see in the Gen Z research. Because nothing else is like that for them. Some of them will have an iPhone, some will have an Android, but all the games and everything is the same. I can still get to TikTok on both of them, at least for now. All of their stuff is available wherever they want."

Except for their Xbox games/services on iOS. Phil Spencer [[I'll Have Two Servings of Claim Chowder Please|one month earlier]].

Phil and Xbox have to pick a side and stop dancing to this in-and-out hokey pokey song.

In fairness, I do think Xbox will eventually put their games everywhere. Their actions are clearer than their PR-speak. There are four Xbox games hitting Switch and PlayStation, with [rumors](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/publishers-are-reportedly-questioning-support-for-xbox-amid-flatlining-sales/) that the majority of Xbox-developed games will become multiplatform. The "console" for Xbox [[The Core of the Xbox Brand|has been the cloud]] for this entire generation. They just [won't](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-claims-its-next-console-will-be-the-largest-technical-leap-you-will-have-ever-seen/) flat out say it.

I'm tired of Xbox leadership talking out of both sides of their mouths.
