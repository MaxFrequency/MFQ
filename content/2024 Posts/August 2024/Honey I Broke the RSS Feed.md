# Honey I Broke the RSS Feed

Yesterday, I began the process of changing the way I name files after running into a couple of small issues.[^1] I decided to use headings to give articles their title and keep the filename separate, but close. That involves adding a heading to every article and post on the site.

And since I was going back through the archive, I decided I'd fix the archive's naming structure from "1301" to "January 2013" to make it more readable.

Syncing these changes resulted in 112 "new" articles in the RSS feed.

Whoops.

Hundreds more will be coming as I implement this change site wide. This will also impact the [[Latest & Greatest]] list on the home page for a spell. I am sorry. It'll be for the better though!
