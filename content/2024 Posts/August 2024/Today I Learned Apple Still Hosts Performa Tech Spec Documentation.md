What's not to love about a good Performa meme?

Stephen's project to [explore Performa and Apple history in the mid-90s](https://512pixels.net/2024/07/performa-month-the-basics/) is right up my alley. I'm eager to read and learn all about this confusing and misguided period.

Reading yesterday's post, hyperlink curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on a link "[the Performa](https://support.apple.com/en-us/112040)." I expected it to take me to some other article on Stephen's site. I never would have guessed it'd go straight to Apple's own support documentation.

Say what you will about [Apple's documentation](https://www.caseyliss.com/2020/11/10/on-apples-pisspoor-documentation), it's pretty cool that they still officially provide this technical information.[^1]
