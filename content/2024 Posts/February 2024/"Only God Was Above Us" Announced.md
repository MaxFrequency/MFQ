[Only God Was Above Us (Album Trailer)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pdpg-1mw7E0) by Vampire Weekend

After missing the first issue (pressing?) of [Frog on the Bass Drum](https://frogonthebassdrum.com) by two months, I solemnly swore right then and there that I would not rest, I would not sleep for an instant, until the next release.

In all seriousness, Vampire Weekend is one of the few bands I regularly search for to get tidbits on what's next. There's probably a better method than the occasional Google search, but here I am. I remember the [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/news/vampire-weekend-new-album-is-done-chris-baio-says/) article from December that mentioned some album news from that first Frog on the Bass Drum newsletter. 

>“LP news by the end of the year. It’s close to done and I feel like it just might be our best yet. 10 songs, no skips.”

They are one of my all-time favorite bands. Thrilled there next album is just two months away, especially after waiting six years for the last one.[^1] For now, April 5, 2024 cannot come soon enough.
