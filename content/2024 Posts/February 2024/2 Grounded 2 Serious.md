[Grounded II: The Making The Last of Us Part II](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU)

I just finished watching *Grounded II: The Making of The Last of Us Part II* and hooooo buddy there’s some grade A Naughty Dog gems throughout. I’ll marinate and have more to say at a reasonable hour, but this gets a thumbs up from me; both as a Naughty Dog fan and someone wanting insight into AAA development. Give it a watch.

Some knee jerk observations though before bed:
- The doco is better because of it being released years post-game launch, letting key team members reflect on the leaks and reactions.
- There is zero mention of Bruce Straley, who left Naughty Dog during this game’s development.
- There is absolutely no mention or obvious sighting of *The Last of Us Online*, a game developed in tandem with *Part II*.
