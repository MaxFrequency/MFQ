Last night, I beat *The Last of Us Part II Remastered*. Feels good. It's been about two weeks since *Grounded II: The Making of The Last of Us Part II* [[2 Grounded 2 Serious|debuted]] and I wanted to check it out in the game itself. Why? Because this was a native download of the video to the PS5 and the game, so it ought to be in its native resolution of 4K and get a splash of HDR thanks to the console. YouTube and streaming bitrate won't hold me back!

There's just one problem. You can't fast-forward or rewind. There are no chapter markers. There's no video player hud to speak of at all. Just a pause menu that lets you quit out of the documentary. That's it.

Based off my observation, the documentary is using the game's cutscene framework to run the film. You can't fast forward a cutscene, just skip it. 

Please fix this Naughty Dog. It's a movie, not an in-game asset. Users ought to be able to skip around, take notes, or show friends key parts without having to sit through the documentary in real time. I get that YouTube is going to be the predominant platform for folks to consume the doco, but the experience in the all-in-one game package should be the best experience. And for a studio championing accessibility, it feels like a miss to not provide basic functionality to an advertised element.
