[Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation](https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite) by Marco Arment

> Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person.
> 
> That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years.
> 
> You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted.
> 
> For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency.

Feels like Marco has been talking about this rewrite for ages. The recently played at the top is exactly a feature I've needed. Excited to dig in to the new design of [[Comparing and Contrasting Podcast Apps|my podcast app of choice]].
