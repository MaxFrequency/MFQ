[Changes in *Forza Horizon 4*'s Festival Playlist and Delisting from Digital Stores](https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting)

> Due to licensing and agreements with our partners, Forza Horizon 4 will be delisted from digital platforms (Microsoft Store and Steam) on December 15, 2024. This means the game and its additional content will no longer be available for purchase through online stores.

And the DLC was delisted yesterday, shortly after this announcement went live. The only way to get the expansions and DLC is to buy the various bundles and editions.

What an absolute shame and sham. Someone notify [[Xbox Preservation Team "Announced"|Xbox's Preservation Team]]. The company can't even pay to keep their own games available for access. At this rate, *Forza Horizon 5* will be delisted in three years. Assuming *Fable* is out next year, I wager it will be delisted in 2032.[^1] I imagine it feels crappy to have all this work poured into masterful games just to have them be delisted because of licensing. Pony up Microsoft.

I guess preservation only counts in regards to backward compatibility? Who cares if an audience can actually buy and play the game? Buy physical when you can folks.

[^1]: This is a joke.
