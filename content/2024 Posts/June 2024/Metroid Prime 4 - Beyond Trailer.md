I'll have plenty more to say about today's Nintendo Direct on the next episode of [[The Max Frequency Podcast|MFP]], but I had to share the *Metroid Prime 4: Beyond* trailer.[^1] If you were looking for confirmation that it was a cross-gen game, look no further than the 2025 release window. We'll have plenty to talk about on [[Chapter Select]] [[S7 - Metroid Prime|Season 7 ‚Äì Metroid Prime]] as well, which has already been updated to reflect the new title and date.[^2]

[^1]:  Which is on schedule to record this Friday. üòÅ
[^2]: We have production status for each season announced as well now. [[S7 - Metroid Prime|Check out the season's page]] for more information.
