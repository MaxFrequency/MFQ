What an absolute brutal tease the top image is. 

It's also a complete admission of failure on Sony's part to court developers and create their own enticing games for their hardware. It's like my buddy Tomas Franzese [wrote last week](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/playstation-vr2-is-dead-astro-bot/) after learning that the new *Astro Bot* game is not supporting PS VR2.

> I have faith that Team Asobi will do a great job with Astro Bot, but its existence seems to affirm that Sony has abandoned first-party support for PSVR2. The only glimmer of hope I still have is for PSVR2 to gain PC compatibility. Sony has said it’s looking into this, and recent leaks suggest it plans to release an adapter to make it work for PC VR. If that happens, I’ll at least be able to use my PSVR2 to play games like Half-Life: Alyx and Boneworks through Steam — then again, I could technically already do this with my Meta Quest 3 if I wanted.

> If you are still on the fence about picking up a PSVR2, don’t.

Cool hardware is only as cool as its software. New cool hardware needs to be championed first and foremost by its creator. The responsibility of its success cannot be thrust upon second and third-parties.
