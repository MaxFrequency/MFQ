[Sony no longer cares about the PSVR 2, and neither should you](https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either) by Nicholas Sutrich for Android Central via [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-has-reportedly-made-cuts-to-vr-development-with-only-2-titles-currently-planned/)

> Sources close to Android Central have revealed that Sony is making deep cuts to funding for VR games. While I'll paraphrase for anonymity, my source was told that there will be very few opportunities for VR game development at Sony going forward.
> 
> To back that up, another source informed me that only two PSVR 2 games are in development at Sony.

I didn't know you could cut below zero. I am slightly shocked [[Big Three Predictions 2024|my lowball prediction]] wasn't low enough. *Astro Bot* [[PS VR2 PC Support Hits the Streets this August|not supporting PS VR2]] was the final nail for me. Sony is going to put out this PC adapter and call it quits.
