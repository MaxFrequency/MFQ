Again, more thoughts on [[The Max Frequency Podcast]], but I felt compelled to share this one too. 

I *almost* called this one in [[MFP36 - "I will be Flabbergasted" with Logan Moore|my summer predictions with Logan]]. I felt in my gut that they'd reuse the *Link's Awakening* assets. I wrote as much in my notes for my predictions,

>  Follows the pattern of Link’s Awakening after BotW, Triforce Heroes reusing asset.

My problem was anchoring to the rumors of remakes for the *Oracle* games.

And as someone playing through *Tears of the Kingdom* for the first time [[Back in Hyrule, Map Free|right now]], I am stunned that they are taking the cloning items/building things mechanic and translating it to 2D. This is full circle with them taking ideas from the original *Zelda* game and bringing them into 3D with *Breath of the Wild*. 

Also, I can't believe this is out in three months. Heck yeah!
