11 years ago today, shortly after getting my first personal Macâ€”the 11'' MacBook Air.

After a little reverse Google Image searching, my desktop today...[^1]

![[240605_iMac Desktop and Dock.jpg]]

I turn 30 years old today. In the past 11 years, I've gone from an 11'' laptop to a 24'' all-in-one. My Dock still focuses on web browsing, writing, and my calendar.[^2] I'm trying out a new browser. I have work and personal email. I miss the inkwell of Pages. I don't miss the FCPX clapper.

I'm not fresh out of high school. I have a kid. I still play video games. I don't have nearly the time I had back then. I still think of *Super Mario Galaxy* often. It was one of the first games I booted up with [[The RetroTINK-4K is Almost Here|my 4K scaler]]. From 480p to 4K. From writing my review for *[[The Last of Us Review|The Last of Us]]* in Pages to writing in Markdown daily. From 19-years-old to 30-years-old. From graduate to dad.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

And I am nothing, if not [[120605_TLOU Won E3.jpg|consistent]].
