I'm going back through all of Max Frequency and archiving my work. I come across [[Spoiler Alert – Dunkey|this post]] about a video Dunkey released in May 2020, right when *The Last of Us Part II* [[The Last of Us Part II Major Leaks Have Begun|leaks]] were spouting off. 

I decide to watch the video to remember why I shared it specifically and to have a good laugh.

Then the revelation hits me.

Somehow, I stayed away from the spoilers of *The Last of Us Part II*, despite being in the thick of it with [[Chasing the Stick – The History of Naughty Dog|Chasing the Stick]]. The layers to Dunkey's video here when you *know* everything that happens in the game, alongside the context of the leaks, makes this video even better.

All hail Dunkey and his deft humor.
