Time to whip up some homemade claim chowder; this time flavored with theories and assumptions surrounding Ellie's mom Anna from *The Last of Us*.

There was this poster in *Uncharted 4: A Thief's End* that teased a comic set in the world of *The Last of Us* titled *[[AmericanDaughtersPoster.jpg|American Daughters]]*. It's been intrinsically tied to my theories and ideas for possible stories in the world. But I have always been [[The Last of Us Prequel – From Animation to DLC to Second-Party to HBO|convinced]] this was Ellie in the poster.

> The red undershirt and revolver that is clearly Joel’s gun convince me this is Ellie and 2024/03/19/claim-chowder-american-dreams-flavor/not Anna.

> More low hanging fruit. It was all, but confirmed that someone got pregnant during the PSX 2017 panel discussing *The Last of Us Part II*. There is also the [easter egg in *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAN0t7-_eI8) with the “*The Last of Us: American Daughters*” [[AmericanDaughtersPoster.jpg|poster]].

I was wrong. Neil [confirmed](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU&t=2520) in [[2 Grounded 2 Serious|Grounded II: The Making of The Last of Us Part II]] that the lady in the poster is, in fact, Ellie's mom Anna. 

> In *Uncharted 4*, you find a comic book that shows Ellie's mom, pregnant.

More layers behind Ellie's parents have been peeled back. I wonder when we'll finally get [[The Last of Us Prequel – From Animation to DLC to Second-Party to HBO|the whole story]].
