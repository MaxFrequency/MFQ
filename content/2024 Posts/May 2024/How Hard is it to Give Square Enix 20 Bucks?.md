I snagged a copy of *Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade* for PS5 at GameStop today.[^1] I did so because I learned last year that its out-of-print and has become [stupid expensive](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/playstation-5/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade). Now, in buying a used copy, I knew that I'd likely not get the code for the INTERmission DLC starring Yuffie and I was correct when I tried to redeem said code. I figured I could just go to the PlayStation Store and buy the DLC Ã  la carte.

You cannot "just" buy the DLC Ã  la carte.

The [product page](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-8094607291671776) on PSN says "Not available for purchase." What gives?

It turns out that to be given the privilege of giving Square Enix your $20 belongs to those that own the digital version of *Final Fantasy VII Remake* for PS5.[^2] To be clear, not Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade for PS5, but the plain old *Final Fantasy VII Remake* upgraded to a native PS5 version. To own *that* you either have to...

A) Buy *[Intergrade](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177)* digitally, which comes with DLC
B) Own a copy of the PS4 version, physically or digitally, and redeem the free PS5 upgrade. No DLC included.
C) Redeemed a copy with PS+ in March 2021 and redeem the free PS5 upgrade. No DLC included.

Fortunately for me, I did have option C, except for the latter part. Originally, the upgrade was not available to those that redeemed the PS+ version, but that has since been changed. So, to prove my ownership, I had to download the PS4 version then go to the PS Store and redeem a free PS5 upgrade, even though I already had the PS5 disc installed!

I had over 170GBs of *FFVII* on my PS5.

Once redeeming the upgrade version, I could magically see the option to buy the DLC for $20. Launching the game also gives you a menu prompt where you can buy the DLC. Would this have worked if I had launched the PS5 disc before all my redemption shenanigans? Possibly. I didn't think to check and the online forums did not suggest that. Now I can't check without logging out of my PS5 and using a secondary PSN account.

This whole article begs the question, why has Square Enix made it so confounding to give them $20? What is the harm in just flat out offering the Yuffie DLC? I'm really at a loss. I struggle to see the sense. It's purely punishment for those that bought the game used, like the old days of buying a used multiplayer game on PS3 and needing to buy the multiplayer pass. Except, anyone could do that! Since Square Enix refuses to reprint the North American version of this game, they just need to flip the switch so it is easier for those that prefer a physical copy. They can only gain from this move. They have nothing to lose.

And Sony should be able to recognize a physical install and let users buy the DLC. Again, nothing to lose here. The DLC doesn't work without the game. The game won't load without the disc. There's no "borrowing a copy from a friend" shenanigans here. I am baffled at the artificial complexity here.

[^1]: I snagged two copies actually. I bought a Japanese copy in a bundle for my birthday given the fact that the NTSC version is so stupid expensive. The Japanese version has english text, so I figured I was fine. Then I found this NTSC copy at GameStop and decided I'd just sell my Japanese copy to recoup some of the cost. ðŸ™ƒ
[^2]: Not dissimilar to the situation where folks that own the physical version of *Rare Replay* [[Xbox 360 Digital Store Shutting Down Next Summer|cannot play]] *Goldeneye 007*. Absolute stupidity.
