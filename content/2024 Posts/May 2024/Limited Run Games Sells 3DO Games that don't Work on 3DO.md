[Limited Run Games Apologises For Shipping 3DO Games On CD-Rs](https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/05/limited-run-games-apologises-for-shipping-3do-games-on-cd-rs) by Damien McFerran for Time Extension

> Boutique publisher Limited Run Games has been accused of sending out CD-R discs in its premium edition 3DO titles.
> 
> Customers who have recently received 3DO games from the company have claimed that the discs aren't professionally pressed as one would expect from a premium publisher, but are, in fact, CD-Rs burnt on a computer – an alarming situation, given that CD-Rs generally have a much shorter lifespan than properly pressed CDs.
> 
> While the 3DO comes from a time when domestic CD burners were a rarity and, therefore, lacks any kind of protection against pirated discs, the console is famously picky when it comes to running burned CDs.

Color me stunned. Limited Run Games has been on my not cool list since February 2023 when [[Kara Lynne Interview with Colin Moriarty – Sacred Symbols Plus|they fired Kara Lynne for being hyped for Harry Potter]]. I will admit that I did go one to order the base versions of *Persona 3* and *Persona 4* from them, which just arrived.[^1] They had a game I wanted and that won out. 

Back to the 3DO story; one thing that has never fully sat right with me about any physical publisher is that we are paying for officially blessed repros. What you are really paying for is all the merch alongside a physical copy of the game, which I get and do all the time, You'd at least think the repros would be of good construction and work on the hardware.

That's what makes this CD-R story so wild. Ignoring the lesser quality of a CD-R vs a traditional pressed disc, the extent of LRG's testing seems to have been trying the disc on a few 3DO consoles in their office. They sold a game for a console that doesn't work on said console.

> " ...we believed would work across all commercially available 3DO systems."

> "We tested the discs on the 3DO consoles in our office and all five discs from the game worked as expected. It was only upon shipping to our customers that we came to realise that some users were experiencing difficulty."

Their statement tries to shift blame onto their disc manufacturing partner. All around, it's an absolute shame and sham. 

I do feel done with LRG now. I no longer even see their marketing in emails or online. I have no clue what they are producing. If they are producing something I care about, why would I support them after moves like this, Kara Lynne, being bought out by Embracer Group, long production times, higher prices, etc.? 

LRG isn't worth it.

[^1]: They were supposed to arrive together, but *P3* never made it in the box, which sucked because it was done in production first. I had to file a request with their support team. They wanted a picture of the packaging, which I no longer had because it was just a bubble-lined mailer. Why would packaging be vital in proving a case? Anyway, the return did get resolved I did receive *P3*. Another knock against the company.
