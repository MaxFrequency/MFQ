The list of changes I have implemented over the course of May has built up enough were I thought a formal update to the [[Changelog]] was necessary. You can go to the page to read it all, but here are some of my favorites:
- I *finally* figured out how to implement a custom font and went with [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). Thanks again for the help from kepano and sigrunxia for the troubleshooting help.
- Implemented a way to reveal the published date and tags at the top of a post. 
- Got rid of the local graph on the right-hand side.

You can read the [[Changelog]] for more details on those and other new tweaks. There was one more big-ish change I wanted to discuss in a bit more detail‚ÄîChapter Select Production Status.

On the [[Chapter Select]] page, as well as the current season pages, you fill find a collapsible callout titled "Production Status."[^1] It looks like this;

> [!status]- Production Status
> Hello! üëãüèª

Opening up the block will inform you about where each season currently stands in the production pipeline with a percentage and a quick count of games played, episodes recorded, and episodes produced. This allows listeners to see at a glance where we stand in the production cycle of new seasons.

A few factors played into this decision. Up first, since I made the call to stop using Twitter/X altogether, the only avenue for updates is this website.[^2] I didn't want to make full blown posts all the time for status updates. These callouts are like the tweets of yore.

This is in tandem with [[Changing Things Up for Chapter Select|our decision]] to not release a season until it is completely in the bag. By checking out the current status, it's no surprise that we haven't been trucking along since finishing [[S6 - Pok√©mon|Season 6 - Pok√©mon]] in December. We did crush *Castlevania* early in the year, but then we settled into a mini Chapter Select vacation. I finally started (and finished) *The Great Ace Attorney 2 Resolve*, which was one of my game goals for the year. [^3] Logan has played a lot more than me, trying to get as much as he could in before getting hitched last weekend. Most importantly, he finally started *Elden Ring*. When Logan returns from his honeymoon, he'll join me in playing *Federation Force*. 

It was this vacation that sparked my desire for a more transparent production cycle. I never want folks to wonder about the show's status. One of my goals has always been transparency with Chapter Select. These little callouts give that. When we make progress, I'll update the box. This ought to give everyone a better idea of when to expect the next season.

As for the overall design of Max Frequency, I am feeling pretty settled in the current design. There are always going to be little tweaks and ideas I want to tackle, but I do think the major changes have settled. Every changelog update *shouldn't* need a proper post, but we shall see. üòÖ Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the new changes. 

[^1]: As of this time, that'd be [[S7 - Metroid Prime|Season 7 ‚Äì Metroid Prime]] and [[S8 - Castlevania|Season 8 - Castlevania]].
[^2]: I suppose it is officially "X" now with the redirects  in place. ü™¶
[^3]: And I shared my [[Publishing My Game Notes|game notes]] as well!
