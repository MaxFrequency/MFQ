[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door got the remake it deserved](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-retrospective/) by Tomas Franzese for DigitalTrends

A couple weeks ago, my friend Tomas hit me up to ask me some questions about *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* for an article he was writing for DigitalTrends about how the game finally got the remake it deserved. It was a lot of fun and exciting to see who else Tomas asked; definitely go [give it a read](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-retrospective/).

I decided to go ahead and share my full responses to his questions below.[^1] Inspired by Six Colors [Annual Apple Report Card](https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/apple-in-2023-the-six-colors-report-card/) and how some of the graders [share](https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/my_2023_apple_report_card) their [full responses](https://512pixels.net/2024/02/my-2023-six-colors-report-card-replies/). I thought it'd be fun. I hope you enjoy!

### What was my familiarity with *Paper Mario* before [[Chapter Select ]][[S1 - Paper Mario|Season 1 - Paper Mario]]?

%%Before playing through the whole series for Chapter Select, what was your familiarity with the Paper Mario games? Which ones had you played before, and what were your thoughts on them?%%

> Before playing all of them for the show, my ties go all the way back to being a kid. I remember *loving* the demo kiosk for Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door that took place at the start of Hooktail's castle. Mario would fold up into a paper airplane and you could explore that initial area. I was hook(tail)ed. My parents eventually bought me a used copy at Blockbuster, but the disc was scratched, so we returned it for a new copy, which I still have to this day.
> 
> I ended up dabbling with the series going forward, mostly borrowing the games. I played a little of *Super Paper Mario* and even less of *Sticker Star*. I'm not entirely sure why I wasn't drawn to those entries, perhaps because they weren't inherently like *TTYD*. 
# Did playing through the entire series reveal any surprising truths? Do you agree with the sentiment that the RPGs are better than the last three games?

%%Did playing through the whole series back to back reveal any surprising truths about the games? Do you agree with the general sentiment the RPGs are better than the latest 3 games?%%

> For sure. I realized the franchise has always used the idea of paper as a pathway to new mechanics; it just didn't *look* like paper until the 3DS entry. There is an spirit of experimentation within all the games. Ironically, *The Thousand-Year Door* may have the least experimentation, instead focusing on refining the ideas and mechanics behind *Paper Mario* on N64 and *Super Mario RPG*. 
> 
> I think fans of *TTYD* often hold firm to the idea that *Paper Mario* should be like the RPG origins, when Nintendo has actually never stuck to that, leaving the RPG dedication to the likes of the now defunct AlphaDream and their *Mario & Luigi* series.

# What are your thoughts on *The Thousand-Year Door* specifically? Why has it stood the test of time?

%%What are your thoughts on The Thousand-Year Door specifically? Why do you think it has stood the test of time as the most beloved Paper Mario titled?%%

> I love *TTYD*. It is a quintessential RPG in my mind. I find immense joy in its goofy, magical world with its turn-based, semi-realtime battle system. The music has a synth blip pop bop to it that defined the era. Each little subplot is unique and engaging as you push toward the end goal. Intelligent Systems took a refinement approach with the game that paid off in spades.
> 
> I think the game has stood the test of time because it is greater than the sum of its parts. There's a colorful cast of characters that you can't help but fall in love with. The world is unique and diverse that feels grounded in the world of *Super Mario* without the rigidity of a traditional Mario-based platformer. The battle system is sticky in a way that invites strategy and mastery without being complex. When all added up, the pieces come together to make a special game and experience.

# What is your favorite *Paper Mario* game?

%%Overall, what would you say is your favorite Paper Mario game? %%

> My favorite would have to be *The Thousand-Year Door*. It's a world and cast of characters that I always want to revisit. 

# Are you excited for the *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* remake?

%%Are you excited for the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake on Nintendo Switch? Why or why not?%%

> I am pumped. I think the visual overall is slick from the previews. I'm curious to see what they have and have not changed. Some previews have shown off new characters that streamline or assist. I've heard new music, but understand there is a badge to bring back the old tunes. Most important, I am eager for a new generation to finally have affordable means to play the game. It's been locked to the GameCube for almost 20 years. It's time to see if new players enjoy this game as much as the old guard does. I think they will.

[^1]: I am summarizing Tomas' questions though. I thought that'd be easier as headers since they were a few sentences each.
