# About

Hi. My name is Max Roberts. I’m a husband, father, ghostwriter, and podcast(er) ~~killer~~. I live in Florida, but was born and raised in Indiana.

I’ve lived in the Sunshine State since 2008. I met my lovely wife Abigail in 2013 and we were married in 2017. Our daughter [[Eloise Siobhan Roberts|Eloise]] entered the world in 2022 after [[The Next Generation|two miscarriages]].

I write for work. Most of my professional writing has been for clients or corporations for whom I am fortunate enough to lend my voice to. I love writing. I wanted to step out from under my ghostwriting cloak and create my own site.

Max Frequency is my place to write what is on my mind, at my pace. I think the name is funny. You’ll find writing on video games, technology, and other musings. 

This place in an amalgamation of all my writing online from IGN Blogs, shuttered PlayStation-themed outlets, and my previous blog, Go Left Gaming. There's over a decade of my writing and podcasting gathered here.

You can see previous work I’ve done in the Archive folder. You can also check out all the [[Gear]] I use. I even keep an extensive spreadsheet of my physical video game collection (Google Sheet template provided by [HumanMan42 via reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/wiki/collectionspreadsheet)).

You can reach me at max@maxfrequency.net.

If you'd like to support my work, you can [toss a couple bucks my way via Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/maxfrequency). This is the only page you'll find this image/pitch. I love Max Frequency and will keep on keeping on, just as I have for the past 15 years. I am thankful you are reading and listening. Thank you. I hope you enjoy.
