> While writing about [[Lessons I Learned in Archiving all my Work]], I kept thinking about this particular "About" page. It's not some eloquent piece or stance. I never really thought to archive it, until now. I think the impedious for using the Wayback Machine to find it was "This is where this whole thing started. How far have I come?" So here's the first trail marker on this whole journey that is Max Frequency. I hope you enjoy.

Go Left Gaming is a blog from a gamer, for gamers. Go Left Gaming’s mission is to discuss gaming news, to review games (both old and new), and to spark new ideas about the gaming culture. New posts should be frequent and interesting to you. All in all, Go Left Gaming is a community, where gamers can come to voice their opinions on the news that matters most to them. Comments and criticism are encouraged, but please with the utmost respect for others. Thank you and remember to always go left.
## Author

Hello, my name is Max Roberts. Since the age of five I have been playing video game. I have grown up in gaming’s culture and have a huge passion for them. My dream is to one day become a video game journalist and work for [IGN](https://ign.com). I want to use Go Left Gaming as a launchpad to improve on my writing skills, receive constructive criticism, and to share my love of the gaming with the world. Thank you for taking the time to read my blog and helping me realize my dream.

[^1]: This quote was from this [interview](https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/02/toad-is-zelda-the-untold-story-of-luigis-mansion-2). Awful convenient it was published *checks calendar* one month before I launched Go Left Gaming. The interesting and important bit though is that, upon looking back, I realized that Miyamoto did not say this quote directly. Miyamoto is not even directly in this interview! The quote is paraphrasing Miyamoto from the perspective of Bryce Holliday, who was talking about this "going left" concept. The statement could be a direct quote, but we don't know. I think I wanted it to be a direct quote. I wanted to slap Miyamoto-san's name on my About page. I chose a perceived appearance rather than accuracy. Thankfully, this quote is not nearly [[‘A Delayed Game is Eventually Good’ Miyamoto Quote not a Miyamoto Quote|as famous]] as some others. [[MFP20 - “A Gift to the Zelda Community” with Javed Sterritt|Finding the truth and the source]] is always important though, so let this footnote set the 2013-Max record straight.
