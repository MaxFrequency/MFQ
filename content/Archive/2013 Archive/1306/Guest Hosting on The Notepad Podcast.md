Hey guys! Just thought Iâ€™d share some pretty cool and exciting news. Yesterday I was honored to be a guest on the Notepad Podcast, hosted by Mitchell Morgan, Dominic Fleshmen, and Cory Simmer.

Episode 13 features all of us discussing our E3 and WWDC predictions for next week. The episode is just over an hour long. Go give it a listen! It is available on iTunes [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-notepad/id594747760?mt=2) or over on Libsyn [here](http://notepad.libsyn.com/). After listening to that, check out previous episodes. The guys have done a really outstanding job. If you like tech, nerd culture, gaming, and some classic humor this podcast is just for you! Hope you enjoy it!
