Guys. Today has been a long day for me. Not because of E3,  but because of college orientation being an all day event. I was only able to catch one press conference live today, Sony Entertainment. Wow, what a show. I canâ€™t possibly write up about all the things that wowed the crowd. There is only one thing I wish to write about before I go to bed for day 2 of my orientation. Kingdom Hearts 3 was confirmed. With a trailer.

The Kingdom Hearts franchise has always held a special spot in my heart. The Kingdom Hearts 1 was the first game on PlayStation 2 that I ever saw. It instantly grasped me with its amazing graphics, Disney tie-ins, and real-time combat system. I have been a fan from day one. For the past 10 years, fans have been waiting for the next numbered sequel in the franchise. Tonight, June 10, that game, Kingdom Hearts 3, was confirmed. Here is the trailer. Please enjoy.

I cannot express enough joy that I could see this reveal live and write about it. The Kingdom Hearts franchise is my favorite and closest to my heart despite all its flaws (of which there are many). It means so much that I can share this with you. Thank you. Please expect more articles on E3 in the days to come, especially with my coverage of the Nintendo demos at my local Best Buy. Thank you for supporting me. It means more to me than you know. Just like Kingdom Hearts means the world to me.
