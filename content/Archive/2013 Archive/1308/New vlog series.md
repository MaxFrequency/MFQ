Have your heard the news? No? That’s what this post is all about. Here at Go Left Gaming, I have decide to start a weekly vlog over on Go Left Gaming’s [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/MaxFrequency). Not only will  this allow me to tackle gaming news and topics I may not write about, the vlog will also help me practice my camera time skills and become comfortable discussing topics, both in video and audio formats. These are the baby steps toward something bigger and better. I hope you enjoy them and you can watch them all over on Go Left Gaming’s [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoingLeftGaming). I will also try to create a page here on the website to host all the videos so that they are in one, convenient place. Go check them out and always remember, go left!
