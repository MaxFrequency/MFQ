# Articles Approaching

Hello Readers! This little post is just an update on what you can expect here on Go Left Gaming in the coming weeks. As most gamers know, the summer can be a slow time for new games and content actually being released. Since my [[Animal Crossing - New Leaf - Week 1|weekly Animal Crossing posts]] are done, regular content on Go Left Gaming has slowed down too. Fear not! Coming soon I have an article on [[Kingdom Hearts (E)3|Kingdom Hearts III]] and a [[Top Ten Multiplayer Games of All Time|Top Ten list for your consideration]] and for some open discussion. Also, Splinter Cell: Blacklist will be released on August 20, 2013. I have it all paid off at my local game store and plan on writing up a full review for the game once I experience the game. So there you have it! That is the content on the immediate horizon for Go Left Gaming. I hope you look forward to it and I cannot wait to share it with you!
