Folks, here it is! The moment you have all been waiting for. For quite a while now, I have been teasing a big project for this summer on my vlogs. Shrouded in mystery, this project has teased your minds for quite some time. I am pleased to announce that the project was to create a Let’s Play.

For those of you unfamiliar with the term, a Let’s Play is a video series that has a person or persons play a game through from start to finish with commentary. It shows off the game while providing commentary, which is usually comedic. For a long time now I have wanted to create a Lets’ Play. There are plenty of games that I would love to share my passion for with others. The Sly Cooper games, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, and others come to mind as projects I would love to create. Hopefully one day I can, but those titles will require way more time.

With work all summer and a few surprise trips, I needed a shorter title to share with my viewers. Then Shovel Knight came along! My love for Shovel Knight is no secret. As my Game of the Year for 2014, Shovel Knight holds a special place in my heart. It also happens to be shorter than the games I originally wanted to show. It’s a win-win!

Finally the Let’s Play is done! From the recording phase all the way to the uploading process! Check out the YouTube playlist below with all 12 episodes!

Now my biggest goal with this Let’s Play is not ad revenue, view counts, or praise. What I would love to gain from this experience is constructive criticism! Why? So I can make better videos in the future! So please, if you have any thoughts on how I can make a better product, please comment below or on the YouTube videos in question! Thanks everyone and I hope you enjoy my first Let’s Play!!
