# Contest Rules for Left Behind Live Stream and Giveaway

Here are the official rules for the Giveaway!

Throughout the Live Stream I will ask trivia questions aboutâ€ª The Last Of Us! The first person to answer by tweeting @GoLeftGaming will win the prize. The first question will be for the third place prize and so on. The trivia may be about any part of The Last Of Us!! From the game itself to the development process! So brush up on your Naughty Dog knowledge! As a refresher, here are the 3 prizes-

Prize 1) The entire American Dreams prequel comic series (4 issues in total, digitally)

Prize 2) The Left Behind DLC

and the grand prize-

Prize 3) The Last Of Us season pass (which includes Left Behind, all the multiplayer DLC, and the documentary) AND the American Dreams prequel comic series

How the questions will be asked-

As I mentioned before, the questions will be trivia based on The Last Of Us and Left Behind. The trivia will be hard!!! All the answers are widely and freely available though. I will ask the questions on the Live Stream with a heads up and mention what prize is associated with that question. I will also Tweet out the question! You may either tweet @GoLeftGaming or reply to the tweet with your answer!

Rules for contestants- Only one answer per person per question! You must have The Last Of Us to win the DLC. One prize per person. How I will verify this- you must add me on PSN (mudkip143) and I will check your trophy list to see if you have completed the game. Thanks in advance for tuning in and GOOD LUCK!
