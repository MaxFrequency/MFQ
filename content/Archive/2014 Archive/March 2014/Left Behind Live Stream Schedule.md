# Left Behind Live Stream Schedule

Here is the final schedule for the live stream and giveaway. The trivia for the prizes will happen during the show itself; not during the pre and post shows. Winners will be emailed there codes after the show.

March 4, 2014
All of the times below are EST

5:00-6:00 PM- Pre-Show; Multiplayer and general discussion
6:00-9:00 PM- Show; A full live stream of the Left Behind DLC for The Last Of Us (end time subject to changing if play through takes less or more time)
9:00-11:00 PM- Post-Show; Multiplayer with fans and friends!

If you would like to play factions after the main stream with me, tweet at @GoLeftGaming your PSN and I can add you into the party. If the list is larger than four, a rotation pattern will be implemented. Microphones are encouraged for multiplayer! Hope to see you on Go Left Gamingâ€™s [Twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/goingleftgaming).
