Finally, five years after the great PSN outage of 2011, Sony has enabled two-factor authentication for users on all their Playstation products. The feature was added in the middle of last night.

On your PS4 go to Settings > PlayStation Network Account Management > Account Information > Security > 2-Step Verification. You can also set it up online under the security settings in your account.

Two-factor authentication uses a cell phone number to text a verification code to users whenever they attempt to log in. At this time, you can only use a cell phone and not popular code generating apps, such as Googleâ€™s Authenticator. For a company known to be susceptible to hacks and security leaks, it is comforting to finally have this feature available.
