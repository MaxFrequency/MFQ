11/25/23 - So I found this when archiving MGS into Obsidian. Seemed worth archiving alongside all that. They seem to link to PlayStation Insider writing by Logan and myself. Maybe this *was* a PSI article. The closer comes off that way.

In the weeks leading up to the PlayStation Meeting, plenty has been leaked and rumored. Instead of sifting through the gossip mill of the Internet, here is everything we know, expect, and hope comes out of Sony’s big event this week.

# What We Know

- PlayStation 4 Slim Announcement and Release
	- It’s a secret to nobody at this point that Sony has created a slimmed down version of the PS4. Featuring a smaller, more rounded form factor, a 500gb HDD (boo), defined power/eject buttons, and a new DualShock 4 controller, the Slim seems to be ready for an imminent market release. It may have the ability to support 5GHz Wi-Fi. The Slim is missing an optical audio port and does not feature any substantial new features like the Xbox One S has over the OG Xbox One.

# What We Expect

- PlayStation Neo to be Revealed
	- Similar to the Slim, although not as severe, the Neo has leaked here and there. Why is the Neo listed under our expectations though? The reason is that the Neo has not been confirmed for this event and lacks any substantial evidence like the Slim. With the Slim already in public hands and in retail packaging, it has to be at the show. It’s a miracle that Sony has ignored its existence this long.
	- Back to the Neo though, some specs have leaked [SPECS]. There is the possibility of it supporting 4K gaming, as early rumors suggest [KOTAKU PIECE], which would be a different route than the HDR support in the Xbox One S. Outside of these rumors, we don’t know anything about the Neo. Hopefully it does make its debut like we expect on stage this week.

- PS VR Sizzle Reel
	- At the time of the event, the PS VR will only have 36 days left until release. It makes sense to see a sizzle real of launch games and plans for the virtual reality system.

# What is Rumored

- Rockstar May Reveal New Game
	- Rumors have been floating around that Rockstar may show up and reveal their next game at Sony’s press meeting. Folks believed that Rockstar was supposed to be at Sony’s E3 2016 showing, but backed out for unknown reasons. This could explain the awkward ending with the Days Gone demo seemingly out of place. With Rockstar being located in New York City, it’s not terribly farfetched that they could make an appearance. Again, this is all rumor, so take it with a grain of salt.

- New Handheld Announcement
	- On August 10, NeoGAF found this FCC filing [http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1260837] that may indicate a new handheld is on the way from Sony. It is important to note that the filing was for a 5GHz wireless chip, which seems to match up with recent rumors that the PS4 Slim supports 5GHz Wi-Fi. Odds are the Vita isn’t even mentioned at the meeting, but one can hope!

There you have it. Everything you need to know for the PlayStation meeting. The event takes place on Wednesday, 09/07/16 at 3:00 PM EST. The event will be live streamed according to Sony. Make sure to come back to PlayStation Insider for all the news that comes out of the meeting!
