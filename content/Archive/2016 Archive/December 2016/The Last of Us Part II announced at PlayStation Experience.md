Shawn Layden, chairman of Sony’s Worldwide Studios, said that the game is early in development but the team at Naughty Dog wanted to share some footage. The engine from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End has been updated for The Last Of Us Part II.

“It’s still early days for the project—the game’s release is a ways off—but we couldn’t wait any longer to give you a glimpse of what’s to come,” said Neil Druckmann in a [PlayStation blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20180620212002/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/12/03/the-last-of-us-part-ii/).

The trailer featured an adult Ellie playing guitar and singing a familiar song. Joel makes an appearance at the end, where Ellie says “I’m gonna find and I’m gonna kill every last one of them”, which is sure to fuel speculation for months to come.

At 5:00 PM EST/2:00 PM PST, Neil Druckmann, Ashley Johnson, and Troy Baker will host a panel about the reveal.
