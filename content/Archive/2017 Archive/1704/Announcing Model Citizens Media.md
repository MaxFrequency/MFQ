Hello everyone!

Big announcement to share with you officially through the blog. If you follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/maxroberts143), you may have seen the latest project announced there. I am a 25% of a new podcast network called Model Citizens Media.

# What is Model Citizens Media?

It is a brand for myself and three friends—Logan Moore, Mario Rivera, and Michael Ruiz—to create, proliferate, and share podcasts and ideas. Topics that fascinate us, real-life stories, or goofing around fuel the fire of our shows. Speaking of which…

# What are the shows Model Citizens Media produces?

At the start, there are four shows. Two brand new ones and two you may be familiar with.

- **The Model Citizens Show**– The flagship show of the site and network. All four of us talk about whatever in a conversational based podcast. Inspired by the Comedy Button and the GameOverGreggy Show.
- **Reeling in the Years**– A music podcast where Michael and Logan discuss and explore a specific year in music. How did music play out that year, notable artists, their favorites and such.
- **Millennial Gaming Speak**– MGS is the gaming podcast I have been a co-host of for the passed two years. Logan hosts with me and we discuss the on-goings in the video game industry.
- **Behind the Pixel**– Behind the Pixel is the name I settled on for my new interview series where I pick the brains of folks in the video game industry. You may have seen my first episode (more on it below) with [Kirk Hamilton](https://maxfrequency.net/2021/03/30/btp-01/). Interview 2 (and hopefully 3 and 4) are on the way soon!

You can find all of these shows on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, YouTube, and SoundCloud*!

*Only for MGS

# Behind the Pixel

An homage to the saying “behind the curtain,”Behind the Pixel is an interview series dedicated to an inside look into the video game industry and the people that make up all parts. Video games are a multi-billion dollar industry and fosters a passionate community. I want to explore the people that make it all happen, engage the community, and get fired up about games.

You may have seen episode one pushed heavily here on the site and my Twitter feed, before Model Citizens Media and the show itself had a name. My interview with Kirk Hamilton was an absolute treat. It taught me quite a bit about conducting an interview. I’m eager to carry out those lessons in future interviews.

To avoid brand confusion, I am editing the blog post here on Go Left Gaming to link to the posting on Model Citizens Media. The MCS post is identical to the post you would have found here over these past months. The content is the same, it just now has a proper home. Check it out!

Mario made a vlog for his YouTube channel making a similar announcement. He reflects how I feel. This is an exciting time for all of us and we are eager to create and share. We hope you will become a fellow citizen and follow us on this journey!
