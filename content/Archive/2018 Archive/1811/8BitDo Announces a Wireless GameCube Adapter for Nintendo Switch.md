The adapter comes out on December 7, the same day as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It sports the classic GameCube purple color with four different buttons. There are buttons to support the Home Button and the Share Button on Switch, alongside a toggle to connecting to a Switch and PC and a connection button.

The adapter lets players use their new or old GameCube controllers similar to the old Wavebird style controllers. It will also make it easier to use a GameCube controller on the go when the Switch is in the portable mode. Users may also plug in NES Classic, SNES Classic, or Wii Classic controllers to play [[New NES Games for Nintendo Switch Online Revealed|NES games through Nintendo Switch Online]].

The adapter appears to have a micro-USB port on the back. It runs off AA batteries, which should help keep them running for a long while before having to swap them out. According to the special features section on their website, the adapter is also "lag-free." It also supports a turbo mode for playing games on a PC.

The adapter costs $19.99. You can pre-order one on Amazon.
