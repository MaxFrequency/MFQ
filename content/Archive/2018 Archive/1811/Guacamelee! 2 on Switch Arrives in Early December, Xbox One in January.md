Hot on the heels of announcing DLC, DrinkBox Studios has announced that Guacamelee! 2 will be released on Switch on December 10. An Xbox One version is also being developed and will come out sometime in January 2019.

The Switch version will be sold for $19.99, with the ability to pre-purchase the game starting today. Guacamelee! 2 will be discounted by 10% if players pre-purchase the game or discounted by 30% if they own Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition on Switch.

[[Guacamelee! 2 Gets Two New DLC Packs This Year|Two DLC packs were announced yesterday]], with the first pack being available on PSN and PC today. The first DLC pack unlocks the ability to play the game as the three villains. The second pack releases on December 7 and features 15 unique challenges and more playable characters to unlock. As for the DLC on Switch and Xbox, it will become available for purchase when those versions launch.

[In our review of *Guacamelee! 2*](https://www.dualshockers.com/guacamelee-2-review-ps4-pc/) by Reviews Editor Logan Moore, we praised the game for having "logically improved on everything that worked from the first game but has iterated on it all in such a way that continues to raise the prominence of this series amongst Metroidvania classics."

I played most of Guacamelee! 2 on PS4, but never got around to finishing it (curse you Spider-Man). The idea of having the sequel on the go, just like the original did with PlayStation Vita, sounds like a hoot. With the game's built-in four-player co-op, the Switch should be a perfect platform for drop-in, drop-out play.
