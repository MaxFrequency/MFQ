Tetsuya Nomura took to the official Kingdom Hearts Twitter account early this morning to announce a wave of new trailers for Kingdom Hearts III. After having three new trailers in November, the Kingdom Hearts III train appears to be ramping up to top speed.

Thanks to Twitter's built-in translation tools, Google Translate, and the fan translation Twitter account [@KHENGLISH](https://twitter.com/_KH_ENGLISH/status/1067415307621359616), we feel confident in what Nomura said in the original tweet. 

Nomura said that the trailers are still in progress, but gave tentative release dates for them. The first could debut on December 10. The final trailer for the game would follow eight days later on December 18. Lastly, a 30-second trailer for movie theaters is scheduled to hit on December 21.

[Since the game has finally gone gold](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-goes-gold/), it's no surprise that final trailers and advertisements are being actively developed. Throughout November, Kingdom Hearts III received three new trailers revolving around the Disney worlds in the game. [One focused on Tangled](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-3-trailer-tangled/), one of the first worlds revealed for the game, while another confirmed that [The Hundred Acre Wood and Winnie the Pooh would be returning](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-winnie-the-pooh/). The final November trailer came out with the announcement that the game had gone gold.As the world gets closer and closer to the January 29, 2019 release date, the barrage of Kingdom Hearts III content doesn't appear to be letting up. 

Just yesterday, [Amazon announced an exclusive Keyblade variant](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-dawn-till-dusk-keyblade/) for people that pre-order the game from the online retailer. Whenever these trailers make their debut, you can come back to Dualshockers to check them out in all their glory. If you haven't pre-ordered the game yet, you may do so on Amazon.
