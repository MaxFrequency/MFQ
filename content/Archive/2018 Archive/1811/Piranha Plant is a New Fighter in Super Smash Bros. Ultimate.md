Piranha Plant has just been revealed as a new fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The fighter will be a free bonus for people that buy the game near launch and register the game with My Nintendo. Piranha Plant will be released a few months after Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launches on December 7, 2018.

Similar to how Mewtwo was free for a limited time when players bought Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS, Piranha Plant appears to be the same. Players will need to register their copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with their My Nintendo account by January 31, 2019 to receive Piranha Plant for free. Piranha Plant is not [one of the five characters destined for the newly announced Fighter Pass](https://www.dualshockers.com/super-smash-bros-ultimate-dlc/).

Piranha Plant’s moves look truly unique, as the character is a potted plant. It can stretch its neck(?) quite far and seems to have some iconic moves for the Super Mario baddie, such as spitting out spiked balls and poison shots. It’s movement seems a tad on the slow side of Ultimate, which makes some sense because it is a potted plant and waddles everywhere.

Piranha Plant is one of three new characters revealed today in the Super Smash Bros. Direct with the promise of five more in the future. Other revealed characters include [Ken from Street Fighter as an Echo Fighter for Ryu](https://www.dualshockers.com/ken-revealed-super-smash-bros-ultimate/) and [Incineroar from Pokémon Sun & Moon](https://www.dualshockers.com/incineroar-super-smash-bros-ultimate/).
