Just one day before being on sale, Avalanche Studios and Square Enix have released a launch trailer for Just Cause 4. The trailer showcases what are surely only a few of the unique ways to destroy a warlord's island in style. The all-new dynamic and destructive weather also shine in the trailer.

Just Cause 4 looks as zany as ever on the new island of Sol√≠s. A variety of guns and gadgets are shown for Rico Rodriguez to utilize as he blows up everything in his path. Rico can drive/fly/steer cars, planes, motorbikes, boats, and explosive gas tanks throughout the island using the myriad of tools at his disposal.

Our own review of Just Cause 4 is in the pipeline by our Reviews Editor Logan Moore. [When we previewed the game back in October](https://www.dualshockers.com/just-cause-4-preview-bells-no-whistles/), we were worried about the wacky and destructive formula becoming stale. We shall see if that is the case when we tackle the game head-on in the coming days.

Until our review hits the digital stands, check out all the gnarly weapons, gadgets, vehicles, and weather (yes, weather can be gnarly too) in the new launch trailer for Just Cause 4. If you want to snag your own copy before tomorrow's launch, Amazon is still doing pre-orders here and offering a $10 credit for Prime members that pre-order select versions of the game.
