Riot Games and Beat Games have teamed up to release the hit K-pop song "POP/STARS" by League of Legends' K/DA in the VR rhythm game Beat Saber for free. Beat Games has uploaded the entire song's level with a performance by Madison Beer, K/DA's Evelynn. You may watch the video below.

The song will be added to the game on Steam, the Oculus Store, and the PlayStation Store today, December 21. The addition is free for all present and future owners of Beat Saber, becoming a permanent addition to the game's soundtrack.

[Riot Games published a new post](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/popstars-coming-beat-saber) on their website detailing the origins of this collaboration between the two studios. It turns out that Riot Games approached Beat Games and asked if they would be interested in adding "POP/STARS" to Beat Saber. After demoing the song for Beat Games, everyone was on board. Jaroslav Beck, the CEO of Beat Games, commented on the collaboration.

> "The moment we listened to "POP/STARS" we knew for sure this is going to be a hit in Beat Saber. The track is so pulsing and the video is just epic–it matches our game perfectly. We are so excited that with Beat Saber, players finally get a chance to experience "POP/STARS" on a whole new level and literally feel every beat."

The patch is already live on Steam and the Oculus Store. The PSVR version should be patched later today. Dubbed v0.12.2 on Steam, the patch also includes tweaks to practice mode to play a brief intro when starting at a specific time to avoid failing instantly and showing an audio preview when skipping to a specific time in a song.

"POP/STARS" has been a smashing success for Riot Games after [they debuted the song at Worlds’ Finals this year](https://www.dualshockers.com/league-of-legends-popstar-skins/). Riot Games released in-game skins for the characters shown in the music video and they sold like hot cakes. [The company even updated a skin later to better reflect the neon style in the music video](https://www.dualshockers.com/riot-games-updating-akalis-kd-popstar-skin-league-legends-reflect-neon-look/).

Beat Games is set to release more DLC for Beat Saber. The details are unclear at the time of writing, but [they did say that it would come soon after the game's release on PSVR](https://www.dualshockers.com/beat-saber-ps-vr-release-date/). Riot Games has no current plans to add more songs from League of Legends to Beat Saber at this time.

[In our review of Beat Saber](https://www.dualshockers.com/beat-saber-review-ps-vr/), Michael Ruiz thought that if VR became more widespread "Beat Saber (become) the Guitar Hero of the VR world." [As for our review of League of Legends](https://www.dualshockers.com/league-of-legends-review-pc/), Logan Moore found League to be "one of the most replayable games I have ever poured my time into and I don’t see myself moving on from it anytime soon."
