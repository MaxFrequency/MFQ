The hit animated short series Sonic Mania Adventures has a new Holiday Special episode. Sega has released the episode on YouTube today. You may watch the cute short below.

Sonic Mania Adventures [completed its series run this year back in July](https://www.dualshockers.com/final-episode-sonic-mania-adventures-now-available-watch/), but Sega has put together a brand new short that takes place after the final episode. The Holiday Special revolves around a rundown Metal Sonic and a cold-hearted Eggman, after Sonic and his crew defeated the villains in the main series. The official description of the short is as follows-

> "Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman crash into the jungle after being defeated by Sonic and friends. Feeling broken and abandoned, as seasons turn cold, a surprise appearance may change Metal Sonicâ€™s fate forever!"

If you missed the series, you can watch all five episodes in [one convenient video on Sega's YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYvO8eaWJNc&feature=youtu.be). All five episodes run for just over 11 minutes. Sega also [published a behind-the-scenes video that shared details with the creation of the new animated series](https://www.dualshockers.com/learn-production-sonic-mania-adventures-new-video/).

Sonic Mania Adventures was released all this year to help promote Sonic Mania Plus, an upgrade to last year's return-to-form 2D classic. [In our review of Sonic Mania Plus](https://www.dualshockers.com/sonic-mania-plus-review-switch-ps4-xb1/), Tomas Franzese found the upgrade to make the game look and feel even better.
