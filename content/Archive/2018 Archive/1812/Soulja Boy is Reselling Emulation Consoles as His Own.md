American rapper Soulja Boy has begun selling two video game consoles on his online store "Soulja Watch." These consoles are existing unofficial emulation options from Anbernic, who sells their products on Amazon and the Chinese online retailer Ali Express.

The "SouljaGame Handheld" and the "SouljaGame Console" currently cost $99.99 and $149.99, respectively. These are also sale prices from $199.99 for both systems. For comparison, Anbernic sells these same exact systems for $59.99 and $79.99, respectively.

The product images for the [SouljaGame systems](https://souljawatch.com/products/souljagame-handheld) are identical to the [Amazon listings](https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Portable-Birthday-Presents-Children/dp/B07F16J7D4/?ie=UTF8&tag=ds-v2-21g9lu1-20&ascsubtag=UUdsUeUpU25579&asc_refurl=https://www.dualshockers.com/soulja-boy-game-console/&asc_campaign=Short-Term), despite the prices being so wildly different. The SouljaGame Handheld is by far the most interesting of the two. It boasts 3,000 pre-installed games for "Switch/3DS/Vita/NEOGEO/GBC/Gameboy/GBA Handheld Game Players." It is listed as a black-colored console, but the purchase listing and images showcase only a white-colored system. It also does come in packaging.

The SouljaGame Console only comes with 800 pre-installed games for "SOULJAGAME/PS/NEOGEO/PC/SEGA/GBA/NES Video Games." It supposedly supports 4K gaming and comes packaged with both an HDMI cable and A/V cables. It looks like a Wii and Xbox One fused together that uses knock-off looking PS2 controllers.

This is hilarious. SouljaBoy also sells his own phone, tablet, headphones, and smartwatch. Why he is doing this and how it is legal is beyond my comprehension. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go "crank that" like it's 2007 all over again.
