The gaming marathon Zeldathon begins its winter marathon today at 4:00 PM EST with the goal to raise money for [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/), an organization that provides medical aid to states, countries, and areas affected by disaster and poverty. Under the name "Zeldathon Response," the charity marathon will play nearly every Zelda game over the course of nearly 140 hours, including two of the three notorious Philips CD-i games.

This Zeldathon kicks off with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest and closes out with the iconic A Link to the Past. Some notable runs include a three heart only run of the original The Legend of Zelda and two players sharing one controller while playing Zelda's Adventure from the Philips CD-i. You can check out [the full schedule here](https://zeldathon.net/schedule). To watch Zeldathon on Twitch, [check out SuperMCGamer's channel](https://www.twitch.tv/supermcgamer/).

Zeldathon began in 2009 and was created by Matthew “MC” Moffit and Zak Ondish. Over $2,000,000 have been raised for various charities across 22 different marathons. Some charities from previous Zeldathons include St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Help Hope Live, and the WILD Foundation.

There are also exclusive tee shirts for sale on the popular gaming shirt site The Yetee. Each shirt sells for $12 and there are six designs. $4 of the $12 goes directly to Direct Relief. You can check out all the shirt designs on [The Yetee's site here](https://theyetee.com/).
