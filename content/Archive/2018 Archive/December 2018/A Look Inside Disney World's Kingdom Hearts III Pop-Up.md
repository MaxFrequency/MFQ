# A Look Inside Disney World's Kingdom Hearts III Pop-Up

![[IMG_7148.jpg]]

Earlier this month, [Square Enix announced that a pop-up shop for Kingdom Hearts III](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-disney-world/) would appear in Disney Springs, an outdoor shopping and dining experience near Disney World. Staying open from December 14 through January 31, this shop would allow fans to play a demo of Kingdom Hearts III weeks before release while checking out replica Keyblades and some Kingdom Hearts swag that's for sale on Square Enix's online shop.

I live just outside of Orlando, FL and decided to check out the shop, both for myself and for you fine readers of DualShockers. I've only been waiting over five years since Kingdom Hearts III's announcement and 13 years since Kingdom Hearts II. Figured this was my time to shine.

Below is a photo gallery of all the photos I took at the pop-up shop, including some with me and my wife. For those that want to pass on seeing it, I've whipped up a brief description of the event.

The shop was in a low-key building with only a small sign outside indicating that there was any sort of event inside. I was met with a floor-to-ceiling canvas with the game's gorgeous box art. An attendant signed me in for the wait list, which took under 40 minutes. I walked around other shops while I waited for the text.

Inside the shop, TVs [played various trailers](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-3-final-battle-trailer/) for the game and fans could sit and watch. There were Play Arts statues of Sora and Aqua on display beside life-sized Keyblades. After seeing these in person, Sora clearly lifts. The Deluxe Edition of the game was also on display with its steelcase, art book, and official Disney pin.

Fans got to play the game for 15 minutes flat on either PS4 or Xbox One. I ended up on Xbox One to be fit in sooner. Interestingly enough, I was playing on an Xbox One dev kit. There were two demos; the Titan battle shown early on in the game's publicity and the Toy Box demo area. I played the Titan battle, a mostly on-rails experience, and my wife, Abby, played the Toy Box.

Kingdom Hearts III will finally be out on January 29, 2019 for PS4 and Xbox One -- only 33 more days as of this writing. If you haven't pre-ordered a copy yet and would like to do so, you may lock it in on Amazon here. If you would like the Deluxe Edition of the game featured in the gallery, you may pre-order that version instead.
