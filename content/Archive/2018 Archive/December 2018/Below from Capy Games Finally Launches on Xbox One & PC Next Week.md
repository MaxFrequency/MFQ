# Below from Capy Games Finally Launches on Xbox One PC Next Week

Capy Games' highly anticipated Below will launch next week on December 14. The announcement came via Twitter, just one day before Geoff Keighley's [The Game Awards](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-game-awards-2018-tga-when-where-watch/). A new trailer has accompanied the announcement as well.

The trailer showcases the unique perspective and art style while asking the question "What lies below?" By the end, the trailer encourages exploration, survival, and discovery. You can see the video for yourself down below.

Fans, including us here at DualShockers, have been eagerly awaiting Below's release. When Microsoft announced the [Winter of Arcade at X018](https://www.dualshockers.com/winter-arcade-soon-coming-xbox-one-details-come-game-awards/) this November, many hoped that Below's release would be a part of the sale. Microsoft also said during the announcement that the Winter of Arcade lineup would be revealed at The Game Awards. While it is not confirmed specifically for Winter of Arcade, Below is releasing near the time of year for the sale.

Below was revealed back in 2013. The game was originally supposed to launch for Xbox One and PC back in the [Summer of 2016](https://www.dualshockers.com/below-coming-to-xbox-one-and-pc-this-summer-new-trailer-highlights-survival-and-discovery/). In August 2016 however, [Capy Games delayed the game indefinitely](https://www.dualshockers.com/below-will-not-release-this-summer-no-firm-release-date-in-sight/). The studio was silent for quite some time before stating they were [aiming for a 2018 release](https://www.dualshockers.com/capybara-games-below-xb1-pc-2018-update/) in March of this year. We had a chance to [preview the game at PAX East 2018 and loved it](https://www.dualshockers.com/below-capybara-games-pc-xbox-one/).

You can add Below to their Steam wishlist if you would like or wait until a store listing has been made on the Xbox One store.
