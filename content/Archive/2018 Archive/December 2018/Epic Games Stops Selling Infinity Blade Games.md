# Epic Games Stops Selling Infinity Blade Games

The Infinity Blade series meets an end as Epic Games stops selling the trilogy on iOS today. All three games are absent on the App Store, with the only evidence of their existence being the Infinity Blade Stickers app for iMessage. Folks that previously owned the games may still download them from their purchase history for the time being.

Epic Games officially announced the discontinuation of sale on their blog today. Epic Games reasoning for removing the [Infinity Blade](https://www.dualshockers.com/review-infinity-blade/) trilogy was that the team is spread too thin between the development of a PC and mobile title called Spyjinx and "other projects." The on-going support for Infinity Blade was not up to snuff for Epic Games.

Global Creative Director for Epic Games, Donald Mustard, said The Infinity Blade series will always hold a special place for me personally and for Epic as a whole. Itâ€™s always bittersweet to say goodbye, but we are excited for Spyjinx and what the future holds!"

For the next month, Infinity Blade III will have some support with updated Clash Mobs, special items, and "other surprises." In-app purchases have also been removed from the games. The announcement closes out with a tease asking fans to stay on the look for Infinity Blade to appear in unexpected places. Fans don't have to look any farther than the official Fortnite Twitter account, where a teaser video shows off the sword from Infinity Blade III.

The series hasn't been updated in some time it seems when we went back to download a copy of Infinity Blade III. Originally released five years ago on September 18, 2013, the third entry in the series hasn't been updated for more recent iPhone displays. As a whole though, the series was often praised by Apple for its high quality graphics and innovative touch controls. Shortly after the launch of Infinity Blade II in December 2011, Epic Games reported that the series had brought in [$35 million in revenue](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-infinity-blade-franchise-has-made-epic-35-million/).
