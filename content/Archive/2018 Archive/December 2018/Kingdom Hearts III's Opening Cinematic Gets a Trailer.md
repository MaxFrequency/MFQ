# Kingdom Hearts III's Opening Cinematic Gets a Trailer

Yet another new trailer has been released for Kingdom Hearts III. This time the game's opening cinematic gets a snappy trailer with the new song from Hikaru Utada & Skrillex called "Face My Fears." This is the first of [[Kingdom Hearts III Has Three New Trailers Coming Next Month]] that will be released this month.

The trailer acts like chronological cliff notes for the key games from the series' past. We see characters and scenes from Birth By Sleep, Kingdom Hearts, Chain of Memories, 358/2 Days, Kingdom Hearts II, and Dream Drop Distance. All these scenes fly in and out while a young Xehanort moves chess pieces around a board. This is reminiscent of one of the first Kingdom Hearts III trailers where a young Xehanort plays chess with a young Eraqus. The only spin-offs not shown in the near two-minute trailer were Re:coded, A Fragmentary Passage, and the animated movie, Back Cover.

There are still two more trailers that are supposed to be released this December. This next trailer will be the game's "final" trailer and should be released around December 18. The last trailer for the month will be a short 30-second one for movie theaters.

After Kingdom Hearts III [went gold in late November](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-goes-gold/), the game's [file size on Xbox One](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-3-file-size/) was discovered on Microsoft's Japanese website. As we get closer to the game's release on January 29, 2019, the more Disney and Square Enix are promoting it. Kingdom Hearts III will have [a special event in Disney Springs](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-disney-world/) in Orlando, Florida where fans can play a demo as well as see life-sized models of Keyblades and more.

Kingdom Hearts III is only 51 days away. As the circle on this Xehanort saga get closer to being complete, you can still pre-order the game on Amazon if you'd like, which will net you [an exclusive Keyblade](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-dawn-till-dusk-keyblade/) alongside the copy you chose.
