# New Devil May Cry 5 Footage Shows V in Combat

A new Devil May Cry 5 trailer has debuted with footage that shows off the all new character simply named V. The two minute trailer shows V in combat with new animals and creatures helping him. You can watch the trailer below.

V appears to use animals and have the ability to control larger creatures in combat. There is some sort of large raven and a panther that appear in combat throughout the trailer. Toward the end, V stands on the shoulders of a giant and dukes it out against an equally large giant demon.

Devil May Cry 5 has been on a role with trailers lately. Last week, [a trailer came out that announced a collaboration with Japanese singer HYDE](https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-mad-qualia-hyde-new-trailer/). A trailer was also shown at [The Game Awards 2018 that announced an exclusive demo on Xbox One](https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-game-awards-trailer-leak/).

[A collector's edition for the game](https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-collectors-edition-amazon/) was put up on Amazon at the tail end of last month. It includes a van replica and other goodies. It will be sold for $149.99, which is a far cry from the [$8,000 ultra collector's edition](https://www.dualshockers.com/devil-may-cry-5-ultra-limited-edition/).

Devil May Cry 5 will be out on March 8, 2019 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. If you would like to pre-order a copy of the game, you may do so on Amazon here. If you would like the Collector's Edition, you may pre-order it on Amazon here.
