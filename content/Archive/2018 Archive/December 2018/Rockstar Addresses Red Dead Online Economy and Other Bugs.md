# Rockstar Addresses Red Dead Online Economy and Other Bugs

The Red Dead Online beta opened up to everyone who purchased Red Dead Redemption 2 last week. The in-game economy has come under some fire recently. Players say that it is out of balance, [pointing to examples like baked beans being worth more than gold rings](https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-online-gold-beans-economy/).

Today, Rockstar Games has put out a statement via Twitter that addresses upcoming patches for Red Dead Online that will focus on bugs and balancing the in-game economy. Rockstar also thanks fans for their feedback and encourages players to submit more via [their website](https://reddeadonline.com/feedback). When talking about the in-game economy, Rockstar said “Our current areas of focus include the in-game economy, which will require some additional balancing in order to ensure all activities are appropriately rewarding and fun…”

Rockstar is also targeting game bugs that consistently kick players out of the online beta. The game was developed to help speed up the roll-out of patches and adjustments according to the statement. These first patches could be released into the wild west by the end of the week, with more on the horizon.

Rockstar promises to keep regularly updating players with their progress while it works on tweaking the beta. The [community’s feedback](https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-online-player-feedback/) was praised as being “invaluable” and “instrumental” for the beta’s future updates and patches.

Last week, Rockstar [shared tips and tricks](https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-online-tips-tricks/) for players as the beta slowly opened up to all owners of the game. It will be interesting to see how the game’s online beta evolves over time and eventually leaves the beta stage.

Red Dead Redemption 2 and its online mode, Red Dead Online, are available now on PS4 and Xbox One. For more on the game, [you can read our full review](https://www.dualshockers.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review-ps4-xb1/), and you can pick up the game now over on Amazon.
