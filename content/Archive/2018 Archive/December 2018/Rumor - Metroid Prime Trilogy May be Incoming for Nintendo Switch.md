# Rumor - Metroid Prime Trilogy May be Incoming for Nintendo Switch

Swedish online retailer Inet has [put up a listing](https://www.inet.se/produkt/6609611/metroid-prime-trilogy-switch) for the Metroid Prime Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. This listing has led to speculation that the trilogy could possibly debut this Thursday at [The Game Awards](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-game-awards-2018-tga-when-where-watch/), along with a (hopeful) tease for Metroid Prime 4.

Twitter user Nitomatta shared a link to the Inet listing and stated that they could confirm the listing is real by swapping their VPN to Sweden. The page itself just features the box arts for the previous games with not many more details. There is also a trailer for the trilogy from IGN.

Nintendo has been hush on the latest entry in the belove Prime series since its debut at [E3 2017](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-gets-brief-teaser-nintendo-switch-nintendo-spotlight-e3-2017/). The game was entirely absent from E3 2018, although [Reggie Fils-Aime said that the game was well into development](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-4-development/) in an interview. It could be possible to see the game this week.

The last time the Metroid Prime Trilogy was seen was when it was [re-released digitally](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-trilogy-available-on-wii-u-eshop-50-discount-offer-now-through-february-5th/) on Wii U in early 2015. Before that, the game was released on the Wii in August 2009. This remastered the first two games, Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, with the Wii Pointer controls from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The collection came in a steelcase and was quickly coveted by collectors and Metroid fans alike. The game would go for $80+ used at GameStop before the game was digitally re-released.

Until the trilogy is properly announced for Switch, you can pre-order Metroid Prime 4 for Switch on Amazon.
