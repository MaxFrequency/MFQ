# Studio Wildcard's Pirate MMO Atlas is Delayed By Nearly a Week

Atlas, the open world survival pirate-themed MMO from Studio Wildcard, has been delayed by six days from its early access launch on PC. The game will now launch on Wednesday, December 19 into Steam Early Access. Studio Wildcard is known for the dinosaur survival game, ARK: Survival Evolved.

Atlas made its [trailer debut last week during The Game Awards](https://www.dualshockers.com/studio-wildcard-atlas-reveal/). The new MMO will apparently host 40,000 players simultaneously as they explore the pirate world made by Studio Wildcard. Players will be able to build their own ships and use them to take over fortresses, attack merchant ships, and hunt for treasure.

In the trailer shown at The Game Awards, there are numerous diverse shots, dragons, and other pirate-themed goodness. You can check the trailer out below if you missed it last week. The Xbox One version of Atlas is supposed to launch sometime early next year in Game Preview. This console-first release is similar to when ARK: Survival Evolved launched in Game Preview on Xbox One. Atlas will launch at $29.99 on Steam.
