# The Last Of Us Part II Will Not be at The Game Awards

Naughty Dog took to Twitter today and announced that The Last Of Us Part II will not be at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards this upcoming Thursday. 

This announcement comes the day after [[Naughty Dog Celebrates the Anniversary of The Last Of Us Part II's Reveal|the studio celebrated the anniversary]] of the game's initial reveal two years ago. Naughty Dog says they are hard at work on The Last Of Us Part II and will share more details when they deem the time is right. 

Development on the highly anticipated sequel has been quiet since the most recent trailer and [gameplay reveal at E3 2018](https://www.dualshockers.com/last-us-part-ii-reveal-e3-2018/). The game already has three trailers that vary in what they showcase. The reveal trailer confirmed that Ellie and Joel would be returning, while the Paris Games Week 2017 trailer showed off entirely new characters. At E3 2018, Naughty Dog shared a new cutscene with Ellie that melded into the game's first gameplay demo. 

Back in September 2018, [Naughty Dog partnered with Mondo Tees](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-outbreak-day-ellie-t-shirt-vinyl-record-poster-and-more/) again to celebrate the series in-game anniversary of Outbreak Day. New art and a repressing of the original The Last Of Us soundtrack on vinyl. With no PSX this year and [Sony stepping out of E3 2019](https://www.dualshockers.com/sony-e3-2019-nintendo-microsoft-comment/), it is unclear when Naughty Dog may end up showing off more of The Last Of Us Part II.
