# Virtual Reality Headset with Six Cameras has been Patented by LG

A new patent filed by LG Electronics (LG) has been published that describes a new way to interact with virtual reality. The headset described in the patent would have six cameras and offer haptic feedback through the headset itself. The cameras would be placed in pairs along the front of the headset and track the user's hands.

The use of three pairs of cameras would take in the user's hands' position, size, and angle to implement the hands in the virtual space. This could allow users to use their own hands to pick-up and directly interact with virtual objects, rather than current consumer options of interaction such as the PlayStation Move or the HTC Vive controller. The use of dual cameras is often used to implement and track objects in a 3D space. The 3DS cameras or the PS4 camera are both examples of this in action.

Placed above each pair of cameras would be a haptic feedback module. This would essentially buzz the headset to give physical feedback to the user based off of their actions in the virtual space. It could increase or decrease based off of the object a user is interacting with to try and simulate a real-life experience.

It is important to remember that just because a patent has been published, it does not mean LG is actively developing this product. LG is not the only company possibly trying new VR technologies.

Valve's VR headset could feature a wider field-of-view than current consumer headsets on the market like the HTC Vive Pro, Oculus, and PlayStation VR.
