# Guacamelee! 2 Gets Two New DLC Packs This Year

DrinkBox Studios has revealed two all-new DLC packs for Guacamelee! 2 that launch very soon. One pack gives players access to a slew of villainous characters and the other offers new, intense challenges for players to push their luchador skills to the max.

The first pack launches tomorrow and is aptly titled the "Three Enemigos" Character pack and will cost $2.99. It gives players the ability to play through the entire game as any one of the villains from Guacamelee! 2. El Mu√±eco, Uay Pek, and Jaguar Javier are all there and feature pros and cons to their play style. Even more importantly, they each will have their own trophies.

The second pack will release on December 7 for $3.99. It is called "The Proving Grounds" Challenge Pack. This pack features a floating temple in the sky filled with 15 challenges for player's to attempt and complete. Guacamelee! 2's five luchador trainers will push Juan to his limits and reward him with unique skins that unlock the trainers themselves to play with in the game. If you earn gold medals across all the challenges, you will meet the god of the temple, Tiempochtli, and face a final challenge for a super secret skin waiting at the end.

This DLC rollout is similar to Guacamelee!'s original DLC release. A costume pack was released, followed by "El Diablo's Domain," a devilishly challenging underground gauntlet of platforming and combat. [On the PS Blog post](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/11/27/guacamelee-2-gets-new-character-pack-and-challenge-level-tomorrow/), there are short gameplay snippets showing off all the new content coming to Guacamelee! 2.

In [our review of *Guacamelee! 2*](https://www.dualshockers.com/guacamelee-2-review-ps4-pc/), we praised DrinkBox Studios for making a "finely crafted Metroidvania that iterates and improves upon everything that already made the original so great," and gave the game a 9 out of 10. In October, [DrinkBox Studios announced that both Guacamelee! games would be coming to Switch](https://www.dualshockers.com/guacamelee-switch-release/). The first game launched in October and the sequel is supposed to be released on Switch this December.
