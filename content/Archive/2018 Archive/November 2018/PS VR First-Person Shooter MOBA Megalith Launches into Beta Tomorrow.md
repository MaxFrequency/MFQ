# PS VR First-Person Shooter MOBA Megalith Launches into Beta Tomorrow

Disruptive Games is launching an extensive, months-long open beta for their hero based shooter Megalith on PlayStation VR tomorrow. A new trailer showing off the gameplay was also released. You can watch the trailer below.

The video showcases the combat, which seems to be a lob shot type of shooting. There are minions assisting in the combat, similar to a MOBA like League of Legends. Each character appears to have a unique weapon and skill set.

The game features five characters called Titans with special abilities. Each match has two teams of two Titans trying to destroy their opponents base. Players progress through the map by destroying enemy towers to weaken their opponent's base.

While the beta is going on, players will have access to two heroes at any given time. The heroes will rotate out every week and each player will have a different pair of heroes to keep up the in-game variety. If players pre-order the game during the beta, they will gain access to all five characters at once. Other pre-order bonuses include PlayStation Avatars, one DLC Titan upon the game's release, and exclusive skins.

The beta will be active for "the next couple of months," according to a [PlayStation Blog post by Disruptive Games](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/11/12/ps-vr-hero-shooter-megalith-starts-free-beta-tomorrow/). Disruptive Games also detailed all five heroes, their abilities, and their unique looks. You can see them below in our gallery.

Megalith launches on the PlayStation Store for PSVR on January 9, 2019. Pre-orders will also begin at a discounted price, although that price is unknown at the time of writing.
