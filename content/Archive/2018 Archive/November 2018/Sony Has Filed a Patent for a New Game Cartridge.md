# Sony Has Filed a Patent for a New Game Cartridge

A patent from Sony has surfaced detailing a new kind of gaming cartridge. The patent was granted last month on October 5, 2018, after originally being submitted in November 2017. The cartridge itself was invented by Yujin Morisawa, the Senior Art Director at the Corporate Design Center of Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The design of the cartridges looks unique with an apparent hole in the top and a port at the bottom. You can look at the various images in the filed patent [here](http://link.kipris.or.kr/link/main/sharePage_EN.jsp?reg_key=gaXejDaQeuOtyJld32oYgA==&APPLNO=3020170056196&DS_SEQ=M001) or take a peek at a screencap that has been attached below.

The patent's publication time is ironic, coming off of the announcement earlier this year [the PlayStation Vita cartridges would be ending production by 2019](https://www.dualshockers.com/ps-vita-game-cards-production-ending/). Then to be followed up by the announcement that the [Vita would be ending production in Japan](https://www.dualshockers.com/ps-vita-ending-production-no-successor/) with no current plan for a successor.

In 2015, Sony filed a patent for a Switch-like console that was [discovered in 2017 on Neogaf](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/this-sony-handheld-device-patent-looks-familiar.1344913/). While it is fun to speculate, companies patent ideas all the time. These two patents are entirely separate, despite revolving around video games. While the patent has been granted, it is important to note that it does not mean that Sony is actively developing a new handheld gaming platform or even the cartridges themselves.
