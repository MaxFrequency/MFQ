# Spirits Mode Revealed for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

Nintendo has revealed the new Spirits Mode, a single player mode for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This mode includes seemingly hundreds of characters as art that can be applied to one of the 74 fighters to provide buffs. Equipping spirits was compared to equipping accessories in a RPG.

There are multiple types of spirits with various levels or ranks. The characters available in the mode range from Metal Gear Solid V to Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door. There are four classes for spirits that correlate to their power level. The standard level is a novice, then it goes to advanced, ace, and legend. There are primary spirits and support spirits.

Only one primary spirit may be equipped per fighter. Its strength is combined to the fighter. As for support spirits, these are equipped to the primary spirit to provide skills. These spirits are acquired by participating in “Spirit Battles.” Players choose what spirit they want to try and unlock and fight in a battle related to the spirit up for grabs. These fights seem similar to Events in the previous Super Smash Bros. games. They contain certain fighters and modifiers that must be overcome.

Primary Spirits have three strengths; attack, grab, or shield. These can trump one another like a game of rock, paper, scissors and play a factor in how to best overcome enemies in spirit battles.

Spirits mode replaces collectible in game trophies and makes pursuing these collectible spirits more a gameplay experience than random drops. While this is mostly a single player mode, there is an option to play against other players with spirits equipped. This appears to be like custom battles in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS. 

Spirits mode is only one part revealed in the new Super Smash Bros. Direct that aired today.
