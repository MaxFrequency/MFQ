The Kinda Funny Games Showcase has been a recent and on-going effort headed by Miller. After Shawn Layden announced that Sony’s PlayStation Experience would not be happening this year, [Miller tweeted out that Kinda Funny wanted to host a show to provide a similar experience for developers and fans](https://www.dualshockers.com/greg-miller-kinda-funny-showcase/). Unlike PlayStation Experience, the Kinda Funny Games Showcase is open to games and developers for all platforms.

The initial response to the Kinda Funny Games Showcase seems to have been well received with developers like Sabotage, who recently release *The Messenger*, requesting to participate alongside Team Meat, Devolver Digital, and even ToeJam and Earl.

Miller has been openly tweeting about the flood of responses from developers since the showcase’s announcement. The Kinda Funny Games Showcase will include announcements from “big publishers looking to announce major news to Kinda Funny Best Friends on the verge of releasing their passion projects into Early Access. Plus, there’s everything in between,” Miller tweeted out earlier this month on October 6.

The format of the show itself is unclear besides the fact it will be live streamed. When asked if the show will be a pre-recorded video or a more off-the-cuff live steam, Miller said it would be somewhere in between the two possibilities.
