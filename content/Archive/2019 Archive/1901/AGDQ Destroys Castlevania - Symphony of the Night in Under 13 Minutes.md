[[Awesome Games Done Quick 2019 Kicks off this Sunday - Here's How to Watch|Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ) 2019 is underway]] and there has been no shortage of gnarly speedruns to make your brain explode from awesomeness. Yesterday the hotly anticipated Castlevania block happened where five Castlevania games plus Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon were put on the center stage for raising money for charity.

Kicking off this ghoulish chunk of the marathon was a run of the iconic Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Played by speedrunner Satoryu on the PSP port included in Castlevania: The Dracula Chronicles X through the PSTV, this speedrun took advantage of unique glitches found in this port to beat the entire game in under 13 minutes.

13 . Minutes.

The run is an incredible showcase of just how speedrunners can break video games. Without spoiling all the game-breaking fun, Satoryu uses a glitch to keep all the OP gear from the very beginning of the game and some wonky quick save manipulation to make speedrun magic happen.

You can watch the whole 13 minute run below and the rest of the Castlevania block, if you'd like. Those games include Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, Castlevania Chronicles, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, and Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. If the video for some reason does not start at Symphony of the Night, skip ahead to 26:27:27.

AGDQ 2019 is still going on throughout the whole week.
