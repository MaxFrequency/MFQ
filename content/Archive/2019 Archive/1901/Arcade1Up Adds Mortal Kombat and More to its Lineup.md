Arcade1Up has announced five new arcade cabinets at CES 2019. Each arcade cabinet is themed and comes with multiple games. They will roll out throughout the year starting next month.

February will see the release of two cabinets; the Final Fight Cabinet and the Space Invaders Cabinet. The Final Fight Cabinet includes Final Fight, Ghosts 'N Goblins, and Strider. The Space Invaders Cabinet includes Space Invaders Color and Space Invaders Black and White.

The Golden Tee Cabinet will be released sometime in June and will include GT Classic '01, Golden Tee '2k, Golden Tee '99, and Golden Tee '98.

September will also see the release of two new cabinets. The Mortal Kombat Cabinet will launch, which will include Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2, and Mortal Kombat 3. There will also be the Karate Champ Cabinet with Karate Champ, Bad Dudes, Burger Time, and Caveman Ninja.

The prices for each of these new cabinets have not been confirmed yet. Current Arcade1Up cabinets sell for $299.99 at various retailers. Some of the cabinets available now include classic arcade staples such as Street Fighter II, Pac-Man, and Asteroids.

The company that created the Arcade1Up line of arcade cabinets is Tastemakers, LLC. Tastemakers' CEO Scott Bachrach said "This is just the tip of the iceberg for us as we continue to secure the licenses our community wants to see."

Tastemakers said that they will reveal more cabinets for release this Fall at E3 2019, which is just 154 days away, as of this writing. This adds to the whirlwind of announcements we can expect at E3 this year, on top of all the press conference and [the new Kinda Funny Showcase](https://www.dualshockers.com/kinda-funny-games-showcase-reprise-e3-2019/).
