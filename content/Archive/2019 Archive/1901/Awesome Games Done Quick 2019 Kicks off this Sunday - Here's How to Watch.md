It's that wonderful time of the new year again where speedrunners gather together to raise money for charity. Awesome Games Done Quick 2019 (AGDQ) begins on January 6 at 11:30 AM EST and runs until January 13 at 11:57 PM EST, according to their schedule. This 24/7 marathon will once again be raising funds for the [Prevent Cancer Foundation](https://preventcancer.org/). Last year, [AGDQ 2018 raised over $2.2 million](https://www.dualshockers.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2018-fundraising-total/).

The lineup this year is packed with some promising speedruns. Day one of the stream is jam-packed alone with speedruns of Donkey Kong Country, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Portal, and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on the European Extreme difficulty. There is a Castlevania block on the second day, newer indie games like The Messenger, and a signature Super Metroid run with the bosses done in the reverse order. You can [check out the full schedule here](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule).

To tune in live, all you need to do is go to the [Games Done Quick Twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick). Using the schedule linked above, you can time when you want to watch your favorite games be played in ways you never imagined. Speed runs are also archived on their Twitch channel too if you miss a run live.

AGDQ's summer counterpart, Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ), [also brought in over $2 million last year](https://www.dualshockers.com/summer-games-done-quick-charity/). If AGDQ 2019 manages to cross the $2 million threshold, this will be the third consecutive event and fourth total event run by GDQ to raise over $2 million for charity. [GDQ has raised nearly $17 million total since it began in 2010](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/).
