Metroid Prime 4 has been rebooted and Retro Studios is now in charge of the project. Nintendo has released a video statement providing this update to fans. You may watch the statement below.

Shinya Takahashi, who is responsible for development at Nintendo, gave the announcement. It seems that Metroid Prime 4 was not meeting internal standards and Nintendo made the difficult decision to reboot the entire project. It will be quite some time until we hear an update on the game again.

Takahashi said "It will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress, and development time will be extensive."

Metroid series producer Kensuke Tanabe will still be working on the project, but now Retro Studios will be helming the project. Retro Studios is responsible for the original Metroid Prime trilogy. Tanabe will "work in trust and collaboration" with Retro Studios for Metroid Prime 4.

Metroid Prime 4 was [originally teased and announced at E3 2017](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-gets-brief-teaser-nintendo-switch-nintendo-spotlight-e3-2017/). At the time, [Retro Studios was not involved at all in the creation of Metroid Prime 4](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios-not-involved/). Nintendo has been mostly mum on the entire project since then with sparse quotes from Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé. This entire reboot comes as a surprise since [Fils-Aimé said last year that the project was "well in development,"](https://www.dualshockers.com/metroid-prime-4-development/) in an interview with Mashable.
