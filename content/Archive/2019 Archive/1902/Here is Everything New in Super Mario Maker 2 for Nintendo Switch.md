Super Mario Maker 2 surprised Nintendo fans last week with its out-of-the-blue reveal at the start of the Nintendo Direct. Thankfully, it's not just a port of the Wii U title; Super Mario Maker 2 looks like it is fully deserving of the 2 at the end of its title. The Mario community feverishly began combing the trailer for all the new goodies, tools, and content they'll be able to play with in June.

After looking through the reveal trailer from last week for myself, I decided to lay out all that's new in Super Mario Maker 2 in one place. There is a ton to unpack. Frankly, it increased my own hype for the game just seeing all the new possibilities that players will have to make the Mario levels of their dreams.

I want to start off with just a list of all the new items/terrain folks have spotted in the trailer. This entire list is thanks to Mario speedrunners Carl Sagan and Grand POOBear. Carl tweeted out his observations, while POO posted a whole video breakdown. I'll embed POOBear's video reaction and analysis below. If not for the analysis from [a Super Mario Maker veteran](https://maxfrequency.net/2021/10/22/btp-06/), watch it for the reaction. It's priceless.

That said, here is what Super Mario Maker 2 looks like it is bringing this time around:

- A 10 coin
- Slopes, with two variations
- On/Off Switch and blocks
- Tornados
- Set Path Moving Blocks and Enemies
- Water Tiles in non-water levels
- Grates
- Background Enemies
- Parachute Enemies
- Different-colored Pipes and Yoshis
- Same-screen Pipes
- Bullies
- Boom Boom
- Koopas in a Car
- Cat Suit
 -Clear Pipes
- Sideways Thwomps
- Angry Sun

That's a lot of game-changing items and enemies. These alone open up the possibilities for more dynamic levels with more variety. However, new items alone aren't the only reason this is a true sequel: there are new mechanics and a new art style for creators to make fantastic new levels. The possibilities for Kaizo levels (i.e. extremely challenging Mario levels) has been increased tremendously.

Vertical levels appear to be an option now, and the scroll speed and direction of levels can be adjusted.  Levels can have checkpoint parameters where a player has to collect X amount of coins to unlock a checkpoint or progress. Items and enemies can also travel through pipes now, which is super cool-looking with the clear pipes.

A brand new art style in the vein of Super Mario 3D World has also been added to the game, with the previous four styles from the first Mario Maker also being present. The Cat Suit power up is here, alongside at least one 3D mechanic that has been translated into 2D. The ability to climb to the top of trees is in the game; items can be hidden in the tops of trees and pop out when Mario makes it to the top. The art style itself is gorgeous and makes me feel like leaving New Super Mario Bros. U in the dust. Enemies and items exclusive to 3D World are present as well, like a Spring Trap enemy.

Then there is the possibility of multiplayer! Hooooo doctor! Luigi is right alongside Mario on the box art, and he can also be seen in a Cat Suit, as well as Toadette. There is a Blue Toad in a hardhat with a hammer too, all leading toward the possibility of multiplayer. At the very least, there should be multiple playable characters. What could multiplayer look like? Will it just be playing levels like in New Super Mario Bros. U or Super Mario 3D World? Or could you create and playtest levels together? I really hope both are possible.

The UI is also worth exploring, since it is essential to the creation element of the game. Mario Maker was a delight on the Wii U to design with thanks to the GamePad. A big concern for Super Mario Maker 2 on the Switch is creating in Docked Mode, since the touchscreen will be hidden in the dock. It appears Nintendo has found a decent compromise with a radial menu system for selecting items, which will work perfectly for a Pro Controller. There could also be the possibility to use the Joy-Con as a pointer, like in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker or The World Ends With You.

The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening remake [[The Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakening is Being Remastered for Switch|may have been the most surprising announcement]] from the latest Nintendo Direct, but Super Mario Maker 2 was arguably the meatiest. With the game launching just four months after its announcement and in the month of E3 2019, I cannot wait to get my hands on the new game. I adored making levels with my friends on the Wii U or [watching races during last year's Summer Games Done Quick](https://youtube.com/watch?v=PLJ4WDhlJ-o&t=74). From what we've seen of the game so far, Super Mario Maker 2 can truly be the gift that keeps on giving.
