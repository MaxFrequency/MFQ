The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is being completely remastered for Nintendo Switch. The game will be released at some point in 2019 and features an entirely new, cute art style. Nintendo revealed the game with a trailer, which you may watch below.

The trailer opens up with a gorgeous hand-drawn recreation of the introduction to Link's Awakening. After nearly a minute, the trailer then goes into a gameplay reveal. The game looks somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. The world has an adorable, cartoon driven art style that seems really engaging.

The odd curiosities of Link's Awakening are on full display with Chain Chomps and Goombas. The 2D sections are present as well. The soundtrack, if the trailer's music is indicative, sounds like another banger for the Zelda franchise. There's an island texture to the sound that really takes you back to the tropical island of Koholint.

Link's Awakening originally was released for the Nintendo Game Boy back in 1993, with a color port titled The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX released in 1998. Link is stranded on Kohonlint Island and must find eight instruments to awaken the Wind Fish and escape the sunny paradise.
