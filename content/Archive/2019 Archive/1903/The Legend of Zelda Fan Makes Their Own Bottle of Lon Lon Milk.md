There may be nothing Link from _The Legend of Zelda_ loves more than empty bottles and the cows from Lon Lon Ranch. Okay, maybe there are a few things he loves more, but those two are certainly staples of Hyrule. One fan on reddit shared their own homemade milk bottle from the iconic ranch in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_. [Check out evermillion81's creation below](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/b07w09/lon_lon_milk_bottle_i_made_hope_you_guys_like_it/)!

The bottle itself looks like a regular glass bottle with a cork. The label is modeled after the label in _Ocarina of Time_, instead of _Super Smash Bros._ where the label is tan instead of blue. It's a very cute bottle that totally makes me want to play as Young Link in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ and taunt all day.

[Lon Lon Milk](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Lon_Lon_Milk) is found as an item in only a few _Zelda_ games, like _Ocarina of Time_ or _The Wind Waker_ on GameCube. While the milk itself doesn't appear in other games, there is a location called [The Milk Bar](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Milk_Bar) in _Majora's Mask_, _The Phantom Hourglass_, and _A Link Between Worlds_, where presumably the milk from Lon Lon Cows is sold.

_Ocarina of Time_ is arguably the best _Zelda_ game and not only for introducing the world to the sweet milk of Lon Lon Cows. Another (more profound) reason _Zelda_'s 3D debut [[The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time's Story is Elevated by This Video Essay|can be explored in this fantastic video essay on why Ocarina of Time is the saddest Zelda game of all time]].
