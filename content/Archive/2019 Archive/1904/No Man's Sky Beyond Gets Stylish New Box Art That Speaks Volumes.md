_No Man's Sky_ next major update, titled [_No Man's Sky Beyond_](https://www.dualshockers.com/no-mans-sky-beyond-update-summer-2019/), is on the horizon for a Summer 2019 launch. Hello Games founder [Sean Murray took to Twitter this morning](https://twitter.com/nomanssky/status/1115573122407784448?s=21) (east coast time, anyway) and shared the new box art that No Man's Sky Beyond will have when it launches. It encapsulates all the announced features for the massive summer update in a stylish way. You can see it in its full glory down below.

_No Man's Sky Beyond_ is set to contain three major components whenever it launches. The first is an online-centric mode aptly dubbed _No Man's Sky Online_. [Murray described this mode](https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1106651808858927105) as "a radical new social and multiplayer experience which empowers players everywhere in the universe to meet and play together." No more information has been revealed about this new way to connect online, but it may be the next step from the [multiplayer mode introduced in _No Man's Sky Next_](https://www.dualshockers.com/no-mans-sky-next-opinion/).

The second key update is the inclusion of full-blown VR support; both on PSVR and PC. Revealed back during PlayStation's State of Play stream, _No Man's Sky_ will be fully playable in VR. No segmented community with this playable format either: You can play in VR with anyone, whether or not they have VR also. Your save is the same too. This is supposed to be the same _No Man's Sky_ through and through. This has been the most exciting announcement to the game for myself and has me itching to download and try the game again for the first time since it launched back in 2016. The third element of this major update hasn't been announced as of this writing.

The game's box art changes over the course of its life practically tell the tale of the game's evolution. Back when _No Man's Sky_ launched in 2016, the original art was a lone explorer with a space ship, some funky space animals and a few flying ships off in the distance. For the _No Man's Sky Next_ update, a crucial addition was made. Instead of a lone explorer, there were now four, clearly sharing that multiplayer was a core element of the game now. For _No Man's Sky Beyond_, an explorer's helmet takes center stage. You can see the reflection of _No Man's Sky Next_'s box art in the visor, indicating that multiplayer is still key to this particular update. But with the focus now being on the helmet, there is a strong emphasis on the ability to put on your own helmet, so to speak, and engage in the galaxy in a whole new way with VR.

It's kind of an exciting time for _No Man's Sky_, which for someone that bought into the hype at launch and was sorely disappointed, is a fun feeling to have once again. No Man's Sky Beyond_may just be the update that pulls me back in and I'm perfectly okay with that. We'll definitely have more to say when No Man's Sky Beyond is released sometime this summer.
