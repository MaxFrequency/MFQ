# Mortal Kombat 11 TV Commercial Konfirms Kitana

The official roster reveals for _Mortal Kombat 11_ just keep on coming. [NetherRealm Studios has released an all-new TV commercial](https://twitter.com/MortalKombat/status/1115237863082295297) to help promote _Mortal Kombat 11_'s imminent release, which also happens to konfirm the return of Kitana. You can check out the trailer below.

Kitana made her _Mortal Kombat_ debut back in _Mortal Kombat II_ in 1993. She wields her iconic steel fans in the trailer as she dukes it out with Scorpion. It looks like she can toss her fans a great distance and turn them into or use daggers. Fans will have to wait to see her in action though, as that is all the trailer reveals for the long-time fighter.

It may not be long until fans see Kitana in action either. There is a chance that fans could see exclusive coverage from Game Informer during their month long koverage of _Mortal Kombat 11_. [They revealed the all-new fighter Cetrion just last week](https://www.dualshockers.com/mortal-kombat-11-cetrion/). Another possible chance to see Kitana before the game's launch would be during one of NetherRealm Studio's livestreams aptly named "Kombat Kast," where they seem to walkthrough various characters for fans.

Kitana's reveal is also in line with [the trophy list leak that happened last week](https://www.dualshockers.com/mortal-kombat-11-final-roster-trophy-leak/). The [all-new character the Kollector was the first reveal](https://www.dualshockers.com/mortal-kombat-11-kollector/) that matched up with the leak. Both Kitana and that Kollector give the leak an excellent chance of being rock solid. This means that there is one more character for the roster, besides future DLC, if [the 25 character slots on the roster is final](https://www.dualshockers.com/mortal-kombat-11-cetrion/).

As for the trailer itself, it's a fusion of CG and real-life actors. The actors portray folks that embody the powers/abilities of Sub-Zero, Raiden, and Kitana. This gives off the vibe that anyone can fight and wield incredible power, all of which is amplified by _Mortal Komat 11_'s tagline "You're Next."

_Mortal Kombat 11_ launches in just two weeks on April 23 for PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Switch.
