# PSN Name Changes Are Available on PS4 Starting Today

Rejoice PlayStation fans! You now can change your PSN ID you made back in high school and have been haunted by ever since. Sid Shuman, the Social Media Director for PlayStation, has published [a blog post on the PlayStation Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/04/10/online-id-change-on-psn-your-questions-answered/) that provides a FAQ all about the long-awaited feature.

Changing your PSN ID will be free for the first change. Subsequent changes will cost $9.99 USD / CAD, but if you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber the fee is reduced by half to $4.99. There is no limit on how many times you can change your PSN ID and you may revert it back to any previous PSN ID you had at any time for free. To do so, you must contact PlayStation Support.

To change your PSN ID, you must either use a PS4 or your computer. On PS4 you navigate to Settings > Account Management > Account Information > Profile > Online ID and then can change your name by following the prompts. If you'd prefer to use your computer, [just log into your PSN account](https://id.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/signin/?ui=pr&response_type=token&scope=openid%3Auser_id%20openid%3Aonline_id%20openid%3Actry_code%20openid%3Alang%20user%3Aaccount.communication.get%20kamaji%3Aget_account_hash%20oauth%3Amanage_user_auth_sessions%20openid%3Aacct_uuid%20user%3Aaccount.authentication.mode.get%20user%3Aaccount.phone.masked.get%20user%3Aaccount.notification.create%20openid%3Acontent_ctrl%20user%3Aaccount.subaccounts.get%20kamaji%3Aget_internal_entitlements%20openid%3Aage%20user%3Aaccount.graduate%20user%3AverifiedAccount.get%20kamaji%3Aaccount_link_user_link_account%20ias%3Aaccount.onlineIdChange.get%20user%3Aaccount.onlineId.get%20user%3AonlineIdSuggestion.get%20kamaji%3Aactivity_feed_set_feed_privacy%20user%3Aaccount.identityMapper%20user%3Aaccount.email.create%20user%3Aaccount.emailVerification.get%20user%3Aaccount.tosua.update&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fid.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com%2Fid%2Fmanagement%2F%23%2Fp%3Fpr_referer%3Dcam%26entry%3D%252Fp&client_id=ce381e15-9cdd-4cf9-8384-0cf63db17f6a&state=f515da2e38dd41ae589e0234186e6f17&entry=%2Fp&error=login_required&error_code=4165&error_description=User+is+not+authenticated&no_captcha=false#/signin?entry=%2Fsignin) and use the edit button next to your PSN ID.

The name change only works with PS4 games published after April 1, 2018. It does not work with PS3 or Vita. Sony has provided a list of tested games that have [zero issues with name changes](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/games-list-home/no-known-tested-issues/), a list of [games with identified, non-critical issues](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/games-list-home/issues-identified/), and [games with critical issues](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/games-list-home/critical-issues/). Currently, there are only 10 games on the list with known critical issues. Sony defines critical issues as one of the following,

- User may lose in-game currency whether paid for or earned; 
- Loss of game progress, including scores and progress toward trophy unlocking; and 
- Loss of UGC or parts of the game may not function properly, both online and offline. 

Sony recommends not changing your PSN ID, if you would like to continue playing those 10 games.

What has been a dream for PlayStation users is finally here. After being [rumored](https://www.dualshockers.com/psn-name-changes-developers/) and [confirmed](https://www.dualshockers.com/psn-name-changes-confirmed-coming-playstation-preview-program-soon/) to be an impending feature in October 2018, it's nice to see a common feature on other platforms make its way to the PS4. Some fans got to change their name early, thanks to [a preview program that Sony rolled out](https://www.dualshockers.com/playstation-network-online-id-change/) to a group of users.
