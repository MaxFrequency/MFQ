# Dreams Limited Creator Early Access Launching this Spring

[Hot off the heels of the Dreams beta](https://www.dualshockers.com/media-molecule-dreams-beta/), Media Molecule has announced that Dreams will offer a Creator Early Access this Spring. Based off the creations the community made in the beta last month, Media Molecule decided that offering the Dreams creation suite in early access was the best way to allow people to create, provide feedback, and allow the development team to polish the game. This early access opportunity will be sold for $29.99 on the PlayStation Store.

The Creator Early Access will have 100% of the tools that Media Molecule uses every day. There will be interactive tutorials, pre-made games, and updates as the early access period goes on. If anyone from the beta created and uploaded a game, their projects will return and be available in the Creator Early Access version. People will be able to publicly stream, share, and create this early access version from the get-go.

This version of Dreams will not include everything the full version will. It also will be a "strictly limited release," meaning it won't be on PSN indefinitely for anyone to come along and snag it. Media Molecule did not specify how many people can participate.

Due to its limited nature, Media Molecule did clarify just who this Creator Early Access program is for. The developer wants players dedicated to creating, playing, testing, and providing feedback so that Dreams can be polished to the best it can be. Anyone that is interested may sign up [here](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/campaigns/2019/dreams-creator-early-access/) to be notified when the Creator Early Access version becomes available.

During the beta last month, fans created versions of Dead Space, PT, a [Spongebob VR demo](https://www.dualshockers.com/spongebob-dreams-ps4-super-bowl-2019/), [a detailed FPS](https://www.dualshockers.com/dreams-project-zero-fps/), or [a pool simulator](https://www.dualshockers.com/dreams-ps4-beta-developer-pool-level/). The beta did not support PSVR, it is unclear if the Creator Early Access will support PSVR or not. Dreams' tools seem quite powerful and there is no telling what people can create with a more extended period of time and active support.
