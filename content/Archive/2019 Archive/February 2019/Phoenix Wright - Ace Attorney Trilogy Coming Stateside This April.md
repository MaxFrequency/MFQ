# Phoenix Wright - Ace Attorney Trilogy Coming Stateside This April

[As promised last week](https://www.dualshockers.com/phoenix-wright-trilogy-switch-release-teased/), Capcom has revealed the release date for the _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy_. The trilogy will be released for Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC on April 9, 2019, for $29.99. Plenty of new screenshots were also released. You can check out the courtroom action is its HD glory in the gallery below.

Originally released on the Game Boy Advance (in Japan) and the Nintendo DS, the first Phoenix Wright trilogy is a hoot to play. [Capcom provided a brief snapshot of each game](http://www.capcom-unity.com/capkel/blog/2019/02/27/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-comes-to-your-favorite-platform-beginning-april-9th) in their blog post announcing the game's release date. Since it's release, the trilogy has been ported to 3DS and iOS. This new port has some tweaks and refinements that the others do not though.

The _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy_ will support English and Japanese languages out of the gate with support for French, German, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese coming in a post-release patch. The entire UI (user interface) has been redesigned with an all new settings menu too.

[The collection released in Japan last week](https://www.dualshockers.com/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-japan-release-date-limited-edition/), alongside two collector's editions. These editions included original soundtrack CDs, art, and even DVDs of the drama in Japan. There currently is no announcement for a collector's edition here in the United States.

If you'd like to see what the trilogy looks like running on Switch, [the YouTube channel JustOneGamr has uploaded the first trial from the first game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X_7EH8Thpo), _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_. The footage is in full English since the game supports the language. It's sharp looking and sounds just as great as I remember it. I can't wait to play it for myself on April 9!
