# Phoenix Wright - Ace Attorney Trilogy US Release Date Teased

The official Twitter account for the Ace Attorney franchise shared a tease for revealing the release date of the _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy_ outside of Japan. The tweet, which you can see below, invites fans to check back next week for the reveal. The trilogy was released in Japan today.

Planned for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC, [this collection was announced last year at Tokyo Game Show 2018](https://www.dualshockers.com/ace-attorney-123-modern-platforms-trailer/) and was promised for an early 2019 release. [Capcom revealed the Japanese release date in November 2018](https://www.dualshockers.com/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-japan-release-date-limited-edition/). There were two collector's editions as well, but were limited to the PS4 and Switch versions of the trilogy. Both collector's editions contained an OST CD, while the "Complete Edition" came with other goodies, so hopefully the US release sees the same sort of treatment. The game will also contain both Japanese and English dialogue .

In light of the Japanese release coinciding with today's teaser, I'm hopeful that the US release will be soon. The idea of playing Phoenix Wright's first trilogy on my Switch in glorious HD wherever I go sounds like a dream come true. This doesn't seem like a simple port of the iOS ports of the game either. The games' menus have been redesigned for a better play experience. It sounds like a great way to bring the rest of the series to modern platforms too.

Check back here at DualShockers next week to see when the _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy_ will be released for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.
