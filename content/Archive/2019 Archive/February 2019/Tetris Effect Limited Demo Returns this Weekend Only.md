# Tetris Effect Limited Demo Returns this Weekend Only

Monstars Inc., Resonair, and Enhance are bringing back the limited demo for Tetris Effect this weekend. Featuring a tiny taste of each of the game's modes, the demo will only be available for the weekend starting on February 8 through the morning of February 11. The game will also be on sale for the first time at 25% off.

The demo will include three levels from the campaign (titled the Journey Mode) and will have Marathon and Mystery Mode from the Effect Modes section. In the full game, there are 27 levels in Journey Mode and more than 10 Effect Modes. Players will be able to play the game in full 4K HDR with a PS4 Pro or in VR, if they have a PSVR headset.

Tetris Effect had the same demo the week before the full game launched. It coincided with a [[Tetris Effect Limited Demo Launches Alongside a Mini-Documentary|mini-documentary about the impact Tetris has had on people's lives]]. The demo is truly limited and will no longer work after that Monday morning. The game will be on sale for the first time though, at 25% off, which will allow players to take the puzzling journey at a reduced price of $29.99. [You can snag it at that price on PSN here](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA13594_00-TETRISEFFECT0000) when the sale starts tomorrow.

[[Tetris Effect Review â€” The Puzzle Icon Reimagined|In our review of Tetris Effect]], we praised the game for elevating the Tetris experience to new heights and being "a stellar gameplay experience, as well as an achievement in game design," in VR. Tetris Effect won both Best Puzzle Game and Best VR Game in our [Game of the Year 2018 Awards](https://www.dualshockers.com/dualshockers-game-year-2018-awards-god-of-war/) too. It's definitely a game worth your time and you should definitely give it a shot this weekend during the sale and limited demo.
