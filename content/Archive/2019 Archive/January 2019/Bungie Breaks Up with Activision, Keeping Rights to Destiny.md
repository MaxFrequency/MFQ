# Bungie Breaks Up with Activision, Keeping Rights to Destiny

Destiny developer Bungie has announced that their publishing partnership with Activision has come to an end. Bungie has retained the right to publish Destiny going forward. None of Destiny's current DLC plans have changed.

The announcement comes via a blog post on Bungie's website, alongside a joint statement from the two companies. The statement from Activision and Bungie is as follows-

> "Today, we're announcing plans for Bungie to assume full publishing rights and responsibilities for the Destiny franchise. Going forward, Bungie will own and develop the franchise, and Activision will increase its focus on owned IP and other projects. Activision and Bungie are committed to a seamless transition for the Destiny franchise and will continue to work closely together during the transition on behalf of the community of Destiny players around the world."

As for the future of Destiny, Bungie talks about what they have learned from the most recent expansion, Destiny 2 Forsaken. The current roadmap of DLC is still on schedule and should not be affected by this transition. Bungie also said they are looking forward to "surprising our community with some exciting announcements about what lies beyond," potentially referencing a sequel or expansion to Destiny 2 Forsaken. It is also unclear how this may impact PlayStation exclusive content for Destiny going forward.

Back in June 2018, [Bungie announced plans to partner with Chinese service provider NetEase](https://www.dualshockers.com/bungie-netease-partnership/). This was outside of their partnership with Activision for Destiny at the time. It is unclear if this new separation will impact the NetEase partnership at all.
