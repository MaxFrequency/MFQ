# Check Out this Mini-Documentary on Konami Artist Tom duBois

YouTube channel My Life In Gaming has released a video feature on Tom duBois, an artist that drew video game covers and ads for Konami through 1988-1994. Some of duBois' iconic game covers include [Castlevania Bloodline](https://e.snmc.io/lk/l/x/e9b3d6a3ac80c33d5ab21f0ddbd79a64/6782796)s for the Sega Genesis or [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time](https://cdn.cgmagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lets-kick-shell-why-turtles-in-time-still-matters.jpg) for the Super Nintendo.

This mini-documentary goes through duBois' career as an artist and how he fell into drawing the art that sold children on so many of Konami's games in the 8 and 16-bit era. DuBois also shares what happened when the Konami work dried up and what he is currently working on. DuBois also never played any of the games he created art for.
