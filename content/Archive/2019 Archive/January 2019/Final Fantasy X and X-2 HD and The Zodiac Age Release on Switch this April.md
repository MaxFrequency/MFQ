# Final Fantasy X & X-2 HD and The Zodiac Age Release on Switch this April

Square Enix has revealed the release dates for the Switch and Xbox One ports of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster and Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age. On April 16, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster will be available, while two weeks later on April 30, Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age will be released.

To celebrate the announcement, character designer Akihiko Yoshida created a brand new piece of art for Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age. You can check out the new art below.

The release of these games on non-PlayStation systems is a part of [an announcement that Square Enix made in September 2018 during a Nintendo Direct](https://www.dualshockers.com/final-fantasy-switch-xbox-one/).
