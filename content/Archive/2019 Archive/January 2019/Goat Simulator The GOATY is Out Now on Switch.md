# Goat Simulator The GOATY is Out Now on Switch

Coffee Stain Studios has released Goat Simulator The GOATY for Nintendo Switch for $29.99 during the Nintendo Indie Highlights video today. The GOATY includes the original Goat Simulator and its various DLC packs.

The DLC included in the GOATY is Goat MMO Simulator, Goat Simulator: GoatZ, Goat Simulator: Payday, and [Goat Simulator: Waste of Space](https://www.dualshockers.com/to-the-stars-goat-simulator-getting-new-waste-of-space-expansion-tomorrow/). The announcement trailer is set to "Ode to Joy", which just amplifies the levels of confusion and goofiness. You can watch the announcement below, if you'd like.

Goat Simulator is already on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Xbox One, and PS4, so the Switch is due for its port of the latest in goat simulation technology. All of the DLC, except for Goat MMO Simulator, costs $4.99 on consoles, while the base game costs $9.99. This adds up to the Switch collection costing $5 more dollars than comparable ports, but the Switch does combine the home console and portable experience.
