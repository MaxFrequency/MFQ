# How to Sign Up for Anthemâ€™s Exclusive VIP Demo

[EA and Bioware announced yesterday when players could get their hands on an early demo of Anthem](https://www.dualshockers.com/anthem-vip-demo-date/). The VIP demo comes out at the end of this month, with another demo the following week. Here is how you can sign up for the VIP demo and play Anthem before everyone else.

First, here is a little precursor information about the demo as a whole--

- VIP demo runs from January 25-27
- Public demo runs from February 1-3
- Platforms - PS4, Xbox One, PC
- Players will unlock an exclusive in-game item

# Step 1 - Pre-Order Anthem

You will need to pre-order Anthem to receive a code for the VIP demo. EA's suggested retailers for physical copies are Best Buy and GameStop. Amazon has Anthem as an online code and lists it as "Currently Unavailable" as of this writing. All three retailers, do not charge your card until the item ships, which could be days before Anthem's release on February 22.

For digital copies, you may pre-order Anthem on your platform of choice (PS4, Xbox One, or Origin on PC). Digital pre-orders are automatically enrolled in the demo as well. If you are a subscriber to EA Access or Origin Access, you will also be automatically enrolled into the VIP demo.

There are two versions of Anthem--the base version and the Legion of Dawn Edition--pre-ordering either version will provide you with access to the VIP demo. Neither has benefits for the demo over the other.

# Step 2 - Register Your Copy (Physical Copies Only)

If you pre-order a physical copy of Anthem, you will have to register a code to your EA Account. If you pre-order the game online, you should receive an email with your code for the VIP demo. [Fans on Reddit started receiving emails two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/a73o9s/check_your_email_for_vip_demo_access_if_you/). You may log in and [enter your code here](https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/anthem-demos?cid=54970&ts=1546473200171).

# Step 3 - Download the Demo

All that is left is to download the demo itself. As of this writing, the demo is not live on any of the platforms. The demo should go live near the live play time, which is January 25-27. Using the registered account, you will be able to play the VIP demo during its scheduled period.

# Step 4 - Play!

Go forth and play! Please be aware that none of your progress will carry over into the full game. You will receive an exclusive in-game item for participating in the demo that will carry over to the full game as a way to show off you got to play first.

Anthem will release fully on February 22 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. If you'd like to help DualShockers out, you may use our affiliate link to pre-order the game on Amazon.
