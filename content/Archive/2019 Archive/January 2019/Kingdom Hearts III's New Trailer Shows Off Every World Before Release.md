# Kingdom Hearts III's New Trailer Shows Off Every World Before Release

The promotional and hype train is not slowing down for Kingdom Hearts III. A brand new Japanese trailer has gone live, showcasing many of the game's worlds in the game alongside with what appear to be story beats. The trailer itself is two minutes long, but has 30 seconds of fan stories tacked onto the front end, making the whole video two and a half minutes long.

The video opens up with fans sharing how they got into the Kingdom Hearts series and what it means to them. This portion is in English with Japanese subtitles. After 30-seconds of fans sharing their love for the franchise, the trailer itself kicks off.

For those that are weary of spoilers, you'll probably want to skip this trailer. [[Kingdom Hearts III â€” Here is Everything You Need to Know Before Release|All eight of the new, confirmed worlds]] are shown off in surprising detail. Both combat and cutscenes are on display for almost each world (sorry Pooh Bear), with a particular focus on summons and special moves with Disney characters.

The trailer closes with what appear to be surprisingly poignant scenes, even when out of context of the larger story.

While these scenes may contain key moments, the [[Kingdom Hearts III Secret Ending and More have to be Downloaded Days After Release UPDATE|game's epilogue and secret ending won't be included in the game at launch]], but will instead be patched in at a later date.

This trailer isn't the only way Square Enix and Disney are promoting their fever dream sequel. [[Kingdom Hearts III Gets a Themed Hotel Room at Disneyland in Japan|Tokyo Disneyland announced yesterday exclusive Kingdom Hearts themed hotel rooms]] coming to the Disney Ambassador Hotel for a limited time. [[A Look Inside Disney World's Kingdom Hearts III Pop-Up|Disney Springs in Orlando, FL has a pop-up shop]] for Kingdom Hearts III as well.

Kingdom Hearts III will be out for PS4 and Xbox One on January 29, which is just 12 days away from this writing. It still doesn't feel real.
