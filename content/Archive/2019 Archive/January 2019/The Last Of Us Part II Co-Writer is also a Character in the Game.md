# The Last Of Us Part II Co-Writer is also a Character in the Game

The Last Of Us Part II's co-writer Halley Gross has taken to the mo-cap stage. In an Instagram post last night, Gross shared that she is "in a video game." It is unclear if she will play a prominent role, be an extra character, or simply be a cameo like Hideo Kojima in Metal Gear Solid V. You can see the post down below.

[Gross originally announced her role in the development of The Last Of Us Part II in December 2016](https://www.dualshockers.com/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-part-ii-story-intense/). Gross is known for helping write episodes for HBO's Westworld. Neil Druckmann, Naughty Dog's Vice President and the other co-writer, [described Gross as kickass](https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/805600975729766400) when she revealed her job on the game.

The Last Of Us Part II is still actively capturing motion capture for the game. Last month, the game's [most heart-wrenching scene was filmed](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-heartwrenching-scene/). Other mo-cap sessions include a dog, [while another had a pig](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-us-part-2-pig-motion-capture/). Besides capturing footage for the game, [Naughty Dog is also hiring for folks to help shape the game's multiplayer experience](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-2-multiplayer-details/).

The Last Of Us Part II currently has no release window, but will be available for the PS4 at sometime in the future. The game was absent from the 2018 Game Awards. With PlayStation skipping E3 this year, it is unclear when more news about the sequel will emerge.
