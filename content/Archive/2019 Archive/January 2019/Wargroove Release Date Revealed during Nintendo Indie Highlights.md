Chucklefish has announced during today's Nintendo Indie Highlights that their take on the [Advance Wars-style, turn-based combat](https://www.dualshockers.com/new-wargroove-trailer-advance-wars-style-battles/) game Wargroove will be out on February 1. The game is available to pre-order and pre-download on Switch right now.

Wargroove will have a full-blown single-player campaign, along with local and online multiplayer for up to four players. There is also a full map editor for creating your own battle scenarios that you can share online. Players can even make their own cutscenes and "branching campaigns" to share with the world. [There will also be plenty of other modes](https://www.dualshockers.com/turn-based-tactics-title-wargroove-delayed-quarter-one-2019/), like a puzzle mode where you have to wipe out the enemy in a single turn.

Last week, Chucklefish teased that Wargroove would be out "VERY soon" with more details on the horizon.
