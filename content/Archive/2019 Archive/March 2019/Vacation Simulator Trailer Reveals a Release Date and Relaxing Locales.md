# Vacation Simulator Trailer Reveals a Release Date and Relaxing Locales

Owlchemy Labs has released an all-new trailer for _Vacation Simulator_. Besides showing off the recreated human vacation sites, _Vacation Simulator_ is also received a release date for Oculus and SteamVR, while PSVR owners get a release window. Players can quit their jobs and go relax on April 9 for Oculus and SteamVR or wait for this summer to play on PSVR for $29.99. You can watch the trailer below and check out our gallery of screenshots from the game.

There are four locations for you to experience a virtual trip on Vacation Island--Vacation Beach, Vacation Forest, Vacation Mountain, and Vacation Island Resort. They each appear to offer unique excursions and various activities at the location. At the beach, you can play with a beach ball, build sand castles, grill, or go underwater at the Dive Site excursion. Hike in the forest or rock climb in-place on a rock wall in the mountains.

At the Vacation Island Resort, you can play video games, watch movies, eat out of the mini fridge or fire off a few work emails. Players will also be able to make a custom avatar. Players can tweak their hair, skin, and accessories. Despite being a VR game, players will be able to see their avatar in mirrors when dressing up for locales or while snapping a selfie. The options seem vast for you to look exactly how you want in this relaxing sim.

[_Vacation Simulator_ was announced at The Game Awards 2017](https://www.dualshockers.com/vacation-simulator-psvr-oculus-vive-2018/). It originally had a release window of 2018, but in Owlchemy Labs' defense, the original teaser did say "maybe?" in regards to a 2018 launch. It popped back up during E3 2018 during on of [PlayStation's Live from E3 2018 streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyHeLvOB3Q). It's nice to see the game get a firm release date for PC, but I really can't wait to kick back and relax when it comes to PSVR this summer.
