Once the next _Animal Crossing_ game was announced for the Switch, I knew I would have to buy a second Switch for the house. I just knew Abby would take over my Switch to tend to her village (now we know its an island this time). I want to look after my own little island too!

We saved up enough for the new console for when the game comes out in March, but we were not sure if Nintendo would do a specially themed console and whether or not it would be the full-sized Switch or the Switch Lite.

Our questions have been answered by Nintendo of America at 7:08 PM EST on a Thursday night. A full-sized Switch is incoming a week before the game’s launch. It features mint-colored Joy-cons and a beachy Dock. I have never been more jealous of my wife. Pre-order locked in; love you Abby.
