Nice to hear Phil traveling to the [Xbox Game Studios](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-studios) during the launch year of the [Xbox Series X](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x). Also nice to hear that one stop was specifically at The Initiative since [[Big Three Predictions 2020|I predicted their game would be revealed this year]].
