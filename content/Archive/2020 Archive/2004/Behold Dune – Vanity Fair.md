[Behold Dune: An Exclusive Look at Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, and More](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/behold-dune-an-exclusive-look-at-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-oscar-isaac?mbid=social_twitter) by Anthony Breznican for Vanity Fair

I’m surprised to learn that Dune is a two-part film: I don’t think that was known before. Glad to hear that the detail the book deserves will be given to the film. *Blade Runner 2049* was far better than I thought it could have been. *Arrival* was incredible. Having Denis Villeneuve at the helm for *Dune* has me unbelievably amped.

Also, this cast sounds absolutely bonkers. Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa, Rebecca Ferguson, and Stellan Skarsgård. I mean the list seems to never stop. Power house cast. 

I hope this movie shakes out to be as good as it sounds on paper.
