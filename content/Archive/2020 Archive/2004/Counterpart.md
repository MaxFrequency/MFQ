Counterpart is a wonderful show. What a rock solid two season run. The fact it was not renewed for a third season leaves you with a wondering of what could have been. I think thatâ€™s awfully poetic considering one of its core themes.

I highly recommend going in blind. I knew absolutely nothing and I think that made for a even more fun and engaging experience. Counterpart is included with [Amazon Prime Video](https://watch.amazon.com/detail?asin=B077MVJ553&territory=US&r=web) or can be bought on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/counterpart-season-1/id1347311657) for $15 a season.

Thanks [again](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1242978526585917440) to [Jason Snell](https://www.twitter.com/jsnell) for recommending the show on his podcast [Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade).
