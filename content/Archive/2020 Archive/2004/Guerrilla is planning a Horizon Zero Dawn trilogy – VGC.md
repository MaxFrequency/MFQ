[Guerrilla is planning a Horizon Zero Dawn trilogy](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/horizon-zero-dawn-2/) by Andy Robinson for VGC

The headline for Andy’s article isn’t too much of a shocker. *Horizon Zero Dawn* [surpassed 10 million copies sold](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-celebrates-second-anniversary-10-million-copies-sold-worldwide/) back in early 2019. Sony has leaned heavily into first party open-world, single-player games during the PS4 generation. It has done extremely well for them. It makes sense that they are continuing that practice into the PS5 era.

What I found surprising in the article was the tidbit that the sequel was originally planned for PS4. Even back in 2017 when *Horizon Zero Dawn* came out, the PS5 was in the sights of fans. I am surprised the possibly considered putting one more out for PS4. It could have been a *God of War II* and *God of War III* situation.

Andy also talks quite a bit about a possible co-op mode. It’ll be interesting to see how co-op can be woven into a single-player experience. I find that games often feel segmented when there is a co-op mode in addition to single player. One possible route would be to have a co-op story and single-player story, but that means players could miss out on key bits of information. If the plan is to have one “gigantic” scope/world, it would be counterintuitive to split the narrative so starkly.

So does *Horizon Zero Dawn 2* become an always online game? Do people that play entirely alone end up feeling like they are missing out on parts of the world or narrative? Will there be two Aloy’s running around in a game or do players revert back to the olden days of Player 1 and Player 2?

I [[Big Three Predictions 2020|predicted]] at the beginning of 2020 that Horizon’s sequel would be a launch window title for the PS5. If some leaks are starting to happen, maybe I’ll actually get this one right, especially if it has been in development for three years. Fingers crossed.
