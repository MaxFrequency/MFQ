[Interview: Head of Xbox Phil Spencer – Unlocked 437](https://overcast.fm/+KEMpuS6w)  

[Ryan McCaffery](https://twitter.com/DMC_Ryan) put out another excellent interview with the Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer. They talk about staying agile with Series X pricing, Phil’s reaction to the PS5 specs, and handling a console launch with world safety concerns due to COVID-19. I highly, highly recommend listening if you care about the next generation of game consoles. Phil is always a treat to listen to. For those more visually inclined, you can watch the interview on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-lszhflhQ).
