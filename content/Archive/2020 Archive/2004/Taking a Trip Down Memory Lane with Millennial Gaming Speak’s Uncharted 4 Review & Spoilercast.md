[[Millennial Gaming Speak – Uncharted 4 - A Thief’s End – Review and Spoilercast]]

I’ve gotten so deep into researching [[Announcing Chasing the Stick|my history of Naughty Dog during the PS4 era]] that I decided to go back to 2016 and see what I thought of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End hot off of beating it. I also was curious how my friend and co-host felt.

Shocker, I loved it.

Even more of a shocker, [Logan liked it more than Bloodborne](https://twitter.com/MooreMan12/status/1248295306971799553).

It was a fun trip down memory lane. Logan and I said wild stuff. If you want to time travel back to May 2016, this is a pretty funny way to do it.
