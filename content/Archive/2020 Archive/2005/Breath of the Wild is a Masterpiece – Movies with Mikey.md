[Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece – Movies with Mikey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suiVi4kjvbI&t=1553s)

I have been a fan of Mikey’s film reviews for quite awhile. It’s fun to hear Mikey talk about video games every now and then. I have had an itch to replay *Breath of the Wild* for a few months and this video helped scratch it a tiny bit…or maybe it just made that desire worse. Either way, this video is a delightful dissection and observation of one of Nintendo’s best three years after its release. Remember how this game was made for the Wii U?
