[Sony’s Jim Ryan: “It’s time to give fans something that can only be enjoyed on PlayStation 5”](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-29-sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5) by Christopher Dring for GamesIndustry.biz

> “I think the best way that we can address this is by providing the best possible value proposition that we can. I don’t necessarily mean lowest price. Value is a combination of many things. In our area it means games, it means number of games, depth of games, breadth of games, quality of games, price of games… all of these things and how they avail themselves of the feature set of the platform.”

Sounds to me like the PS5 is going to be a pricey console. My guess has been $500 the whole time.

> “We have always said that we believe in generations. We believe that when you go to all the trouble of creating a next-gen console, that it should include features and benefits that the previous generation does not include. And that, in our view, people should make games that can make the most of those features.

This statement was in response to making PS5 games compatible with PS4, like Microsoft is doing with Xbox One and Xbox Series X. I think Sony making a clear cut for forward progress is the right move. Microsoft is naturally limiting its developers by making this a standard for the first few years. 

Now, making PS4 games playable on PS5 is a different matter. [[Xbox Series X Backward Compatibility – Xbox Wire|Microsoft has done a wonderful job of supporting legacy games]]. Sony’s messaging has been blurry. Just this morning, [Eurogamer broke a story](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-05-29-new-ps4-games-must-be-playstation-5-compatible-from-july-sony-tells-devs) that PS4 games submitted for review after a date in July will be required to run of PS5. We know at least *The Last of Us Part II* and *Ghost of Tsushima* will also work.

Sony needs to make a clear statement about their backward compatibility plans. Either way, they need to clear the air.

> Overall, Ryan thinks that the games industry can be “pretty proud of itself” for how it has responded to the pandemic. But he acknowledges that uncertainty remains. Right now, PS5 is coming, its games are on track and there’s plenty of excitement that’s sure to deliver a strong launch. But there are potentially longer-term challenges, and for consumers there may be games that will take a little longer to arrive.

Not only is the PS5 on track, but apparently its games are too. Nice to have reassurance that they still are on time. [[PlayStation 5 Event Announced for June 4|Wonder what we will see next week]].
