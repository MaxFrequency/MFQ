> Our goal remains to launch Xbox Series X and Halo Infinite this Holiday

The most important take away from this announcement.

> Starting with the May 7 episode of Inside Xbox, we will be showcasing what happens next in the world of Xbox, every month…

The way Microsoft has handled the reveal and build up for the Series X is exciting to watch. They have kept the flow of information open and regularly amp up the hype. They are simply crushing it. The 3rd party reveals this Thursday will continue Microsoft’s trend to be the first at delivering next-gen news.

> In July, we will dedicate time to focus on the incredible games coming from Xbox Game Studios. A number of our studio teams are looking forward to sharing first looks at new gameplay, insights from development teams being optimized for Xbox Series X, and brand-new game announcements.  We cannot wait to share this initial look at what some of those teams are working on.

Since these Xbox 20/20 streams are monthly, I wonder what will take place in June. It is super nice to just *know* when we will finally see Xbox Game Studios games, especially since it is probably a [Locke](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Jameson_Locke) that *Halo Infinite* gameplay will be shown. The hype train is getting ready to leave the station.
