I understand *Fortnite* has become more than a battle royale game. It’s a social hub for hanging out and going to concerts. It certainly is experimenting with world-wide entertainment. Warner Bros. and Epic have clearly made a deal.

But I cannot imagine that Christopher Nolan, [a huge proponent of shooting his movies on film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtH6kiPbMBw) and releasing them in a 70mm IMAX film format, is rooting for his next blockbuster to have a trailer debut on a [virtual movie theater screen with 100 dancing avatars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lJlaP-2HY). That sounds like a terrible way to actually watch any video/trailer/movie.

I’ll just wait for the YouTube release.
