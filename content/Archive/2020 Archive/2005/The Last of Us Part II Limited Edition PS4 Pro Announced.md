[Celebrating The Last of Us Part II With a Limited Edition PS4 Pro Bundle and More – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/05/19/celebrating-the-last-of-us-part-ii-with-a-limited-edition-ps4-pro-bundle-and-more/)

Wasn’t sure if this would happen or not, considering there was no word before the indefinite delay. This has obviously been in production for some time though, especially when you think about the game’s originally planned February 2020 release date. Being announced exactly one month before the game’s launch makes sense in light of all the surrounding circumstance.

As for the design of the console itself, it has a matte gray/black finish with Ellie’s moth tattoo engraved on the top: The game’s title is printed on front middle section, beneath the disc drive. The controller features the same coloring with the tattoo embossed on the right handle with the game’s logo stamped on the touch pad. The bundle comes with the typical 1TB hard drive and a standard edition copy of *The Last of Us Part II*.

Overall, I find the console design sleek and clean. I prefer dark matte materials to be used on tech, especially over glossy bright colors. The tattoo art being engraved into the console gives a unique texture (not that you’d be running your fingers over it regularly). It sort of mirrors the process of a real tattoo; scratching into the surface to permanently alter it with art. [Out of the plethora of PS4 console variants](https://www.androidcentral.com/every-limited-edition-playstation-4-you-can-buy-today), this is one of the better looking ones, in my opinion. [I do wish the game’s name was not stamped on the front though](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263510/ps4-last-of-us-part-2-bundle-stop-brands). I think [[tlou_ps4_pro_no_text.jpg|it would look much better]].

Sony also announced a matching Gold Wireless headset and a Seagate 2TB external hard drive. I do like the crimson padding on the headset, but I wish it was a Platinum model instead. This does give me hope for a special audio mode for *The Last of Us Part II* like the first game had on the PS3 with the Pulse wireless headset. Fans may also buy the controller individually.

Whoops.
