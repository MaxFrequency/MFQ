[PlayStation planning June 4 PS5 event, CEO says supplies look good for launch](https://www.cnet.com/news/playstation-planning-june-4-ps5-event-ceo-says-supplies-look-good-for-launch/) by Ian Sherr for CNET

While the primary focus of the article is the [[PlayStation 5 Event Announced for June 4|recently announced PS5 event]], you can’t write about PlayStation right now without mentioning *The Last of Us Part II*.

> Despite the drama, Ryan said demand for the game remains strong. In one example, he noted that Sony tallied more preorders in Europe for The Last of Us Part II than it did for Marvel’s Spider-Man at the same point before its launch. That 2018 superhero game, which was also a PS4 exclusive, was considered one of the best games of that year.

> “We hope this’ll be a defining game for this generation,” Ryan said of The Last of Us Part II. And though Sony hasn’t announced plans to offer a more visually rich version of the game for the PS5 when it launches, Ryan said the version launched in June will run on the PS5 without issue.

Genuinely surprised that *The Last of Us Part II* is already outpacing *Marvel’s Spider-Man* in Europe. Sony is going to have another record-setter on their hands.
