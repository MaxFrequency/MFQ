> “What we did was a combination of a bunch of quads, but moving throughout the environment and then positional quads, but also moving quads in that when you move your head the quads are positional, but also ones that are going with you and then ones that you go through and that are collapsing and that combination is so much more intricate than games that are out right now, mostly because they don’t have enough CPU to be able to do that. They don’t have enough sound bank memory to be able to have all that stuff.” – Jeremy Rogers

Allow me to introduce you to the PS5’s dedicated 3D sound engine Tempest with “[performance and bandwidth comparable to eight PS4 CPU cores combined](https://www.vg247.com/2020/03/18/ps5-3d-audio-tempest-engine/).”

The PS5 is going to make games sound insane!
