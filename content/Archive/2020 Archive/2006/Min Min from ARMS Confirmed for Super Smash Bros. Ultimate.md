The second wave of DLC fighters for *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate* has begun with Nintendo officially confirming that [Min Min](https://arms.fandom.com/wiki/Min_Min) will be the fighter from *ARMS*. What would have likely been revealed three weeks ago was instead pre-recorded nearly two months ago from series creator Masahiro Sakurai’s home. 

As a fighter, Min Min looks fun with a unique emphasis on distance and spacing. I think the stage design is slick too, despite the fact it will likely never be tournament legal. Also, [[The ARMS Theme Song Still Slaps|friendly reminder that the ARMS theme song slaps]].

I personally still don’t even have all the original fighters unlocked, let alone the DLC. Whenever friends get together to play *Smash*, we always play someone else’s copy. Excited to see how people take to Min Min next week.
