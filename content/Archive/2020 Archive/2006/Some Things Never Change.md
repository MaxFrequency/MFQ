I’ve been reading *The Making of Prince of Persia Journals 1985 — 1993* for the past few weeks. Absolutely wonderful insight to the creative process as a whole and the hurdles of game development. While the book may span only eight years, the experience comes off as timeless.

One element I am captivated by is Jordan Mechner’s obsession with fluid, lifelike animation and how he pulled it off on an Apple II. [Watch the game in action](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fggouSd3dr4&t=155). Remarkable stuff. In the book, there is an ad that was used to promote the game. It’s a typical advert with quotes from reviews and some screenshots.

The emphasis on the animation was certainly justified. Mechner would film people then take the film frame-by-frame and animate the game characters.

I find it fascinating that nearly 35 years later, the video game industry is still obsessively pursuing lifelike animation.
