> “We have decided to postpone the PlayStation 5 event scheduled for June 4. While we understand gamers worldwide are excited to see PS5 games, we do not feel that right now is a time for celebration and for now, we want to stand back and allow more important voices to be heard.” – Sony via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1267525525825900549/photo/1)

Sony is making the right move here. This is not the time for people to continue to bury their heads in the sand or be distracted by a shiny object. We need to look at racism, police brutality, and injustice head-on. Human lives are and have been on the line. We can play video games later.
