First Europe and now Brazil. I wonder how the game is doing State-side. *God of War* broke 3.1 million sold in three days. *Marvel’s Spider-Man* broke 3.3 million in three days. I also just learned that [*Final Fantasy VII Remake* sold 3.5 million units in same period of time](https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-sales-reviews).

My final guess is that *The Last of Us Part II* will break 3.7 million units sold in three days. I’m not intentionally increasing it by .2, I swear. That was my guess before I learned about *Final Fantasy VII Remake*.

If you missed it, I finally published [[Chasing the Stick - The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era]] yesterday. It covers Naughty Dog for the whole generation. Including the long development of *The Last of Us Part II*. [[Chasing the Stick - The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era|You may read or listen to the entire story for free right here]].
