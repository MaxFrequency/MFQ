[The Last of Us Part II sells more than 4 million copies – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/26/the-last-of-us-part-ii-sells-more-than-4-million-copies/)

> We’re delighted to report that *The Last of Us Part II* is now the fastest-selling PS4 exclusive ever with more than 4 million copies sold through as of June 21.

I had to take a break from writing my review to share this news. The previous record holder was *Final Fantasy VII Remake* with 3.5 million copies and the previous first-party exclusive to hold the record was *Marvel’s Spider-Man* with 3.3 million copies. And that 4 million was five days ago.

It became the [top-selling first-party PS4 exclusive in Japan](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-japan-sales-launch/) its opening week. [It outperformed *GTA V*’s launch on PlayStation in Russia](https://web.archive.org/web/20200629233355/https://ru.ign.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4/93164/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-stala-rekordsmenkoi-na-rossiiskom-rynke-playstation).

For even more context, *The Last of Us* sold 7 million copies at the end of the PS3’s lifecycle in one year. Combined with *The Last of Us Remastered*, the original game has sold 20 million copies in six years. *The Last of Us Part II* did nearly 1/4 of those numbers in three days at the end of the PS4’s lifecycle.

May its survival be long indeed.
