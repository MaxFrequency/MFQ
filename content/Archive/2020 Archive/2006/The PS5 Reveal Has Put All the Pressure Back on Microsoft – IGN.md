[Opinion: The PS5 Reveal Has Put All the Pressure Back on Microsoft](https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-the-ps5-reveal-has-put-all-the-pressure-back-on-microsoft) by Ryan McCaffrey for IGN

> But none of those services ultimately matter without great games. And not “great” on the IGN scale (8 out of 10), but the 10-out-of-10 masterpiece-level games that Sony has delivered time and again this generation, and Microsoft hasn’t done since the Xbox 360 days. It’s not just a first-party situation either. Sony seems to have no issue with luring third-party developers to its platform with timed exclusivity deals. Microsoft, in turn, is more bearish on the practice. To that end, I would argue that there’s more riding on that July showcase than there’s ever been for another event in the entire history of the Xbox.

A video game console is only as good as the games you can play on it. Microsoft has been crushing it with the Xbox Series X reveals by announcing [[Xbox Series X Smart Delivery – Xbox Wire|consumer friendly features]], [[Xbox Series X Backward Compatibility – Xbox Wire|legacy support]], and [[Xbox Series X Inside and Out|bonkers specs]]. Now, Microsoft needs the games.

[[The Games from the PS5 Event|Sony showed off a strong line-up of PS5 games last week]] and Sony has the history to instill confidence that these titles will be top tier. Microsoft needs to know this July showcase out of the park.
