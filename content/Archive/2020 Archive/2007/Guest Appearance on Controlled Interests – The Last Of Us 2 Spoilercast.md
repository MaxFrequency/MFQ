[The Last Of Us Part 2 Spoilercast – Controlled Interests Gamecast Special – Podcast](https://overcast.fm/+HJ7nuTVSg)

It did not take long for me to [[Guest Appearance on Controlled Interests Episode 193 – PlayStation 5 Reveal Event Reactions and Analysis|return]] to *Controlled Interest*. Jerrad invited me back to dig into *The Last of Us Part II* with [himself](https://twitter.com/Jerrad_), [Dom](https://twitter.com/domsoreos), and [Chris Nunes](https://twitter.com/tophernunes). It was actually the first spoilercast for the game I even engaged with as I’ve stayed away until I could finish my own review (which is finally in the editing process). The four of us had an engaging discussion and I personally had a great time. I hope you enjoy.
