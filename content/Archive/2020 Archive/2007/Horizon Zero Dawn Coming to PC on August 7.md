[Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition for PC – PC Features Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4St-fv53Q0&feature=youtu.be)

[[Horizon Zero Dawn is Coming to PC|Announced back in March]], *Horizon Zero Dawn* is finally making the transition to PC on August 7. It will be available on both Steam and the Epic Games Store for $49.99. It sports the typical PC features/settings like unlocked frame rates and ultra-wide resolutions. It’s exciting to finally be able to see what the [[Is PlayStation Entering the Video Game Engine Business?|Decima engine]] will be fully capable of on PC, alongside the imminent release of *[[Returning to Death Stranding Six Months Later|Death Stranding]]* for PC.

I’m curious how many of these features will make their way to [[The Games from the PS5 Event|*Horizon Forbidden West* on PS5]]…and how much better the sequel will look. This will be a great move to get a wider audience jazzed for the sequel on PS5. Could certainly help move units early on.
