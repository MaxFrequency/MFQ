[How Ghost of Tsushima teamed with Akira Kurosawa estate for cinematic mode](https://ew.com/gaming/ghost-of-tsushima-akira-kurosawa-estate-cinematic-mode/) by Nick Romano for EW

> ‘What would be awesome would be if we could call it Kurosawa Mode.’ In order to do that, we felt that we needed to reach out to the estate and see if that’s something they’d be interested in. We sent a short video showing what it generally looks like, what it feels like.”

> It’s not just a black-and-white filter, Connell clarifies. “We actually did some research on the curves that may have existed on that kind of film that (Kurosawa) might’ve used.”

I am actually surprised it is actually called “Kurosawa Mode.” It is dope that the mode is more than a black and white filter too. The wind is amped up (which makes me wonder how the “Guiding Wind” will act in Kurosawa Mode) and the sound is tweaked to sound like an old TV from the 1950s. This mode is going to look fantastic on my 4K OLED TV.

Now I just need to finally watch *Seven Samurai* before next Friday…
