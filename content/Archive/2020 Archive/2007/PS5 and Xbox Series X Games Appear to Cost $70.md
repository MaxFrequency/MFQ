[NBA 2K21 Current-Gen Release Date Revealed Alongside Special Kobe Bryant Mamba Forever Edition](https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k21-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-special-kobe-bryant-mamba-forever-edition-cover-star-zion-williamson-damian-lillard) by Adam Bankhurst for IGN  

> Furthermore, the standard PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of *NBA 2K21* will cost $69.99 USD, a $10 increase over the current-generation platforms and that makes *NBA 2K21* the first next-gen game to commit to that price point. 

Games can cost millions to make, so an increase in price was bound to happen eventually. For games of a massive scale, like *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* or *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, I’d be comfortable with paying $70, but I do realize that a $10 jump can be a lot for some people. Even huge blockbuster titles like *The Last of Us Part II* are worth $70, in my opinion. Sport games are a harder pitch for me, but I don’t play those games; that doesn’t belittle their worth or cost to develop.  

Some recent releases have also been cheaper than the typical $60 price point. *Spongebob: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated* is a $30 game; *Star Wars Squadrons* (a brand new Star Wars game!), is releasing at $40. I’m curious how wide the range will be during next-gen: Will *Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales* be $40 just like *Uncharted: The Lost Legac*y was (a game it is [compared](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/18/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-an-update-from-insomniac-games/) to in scope) or will it be $50 or $60?  

Both Sony and Microsoft need to reveal the price points for their new consoles. It is getting closer and closer to the Holiday season when these systems are expected to launch. How long will they keep consumers in the dark? How long will publishers stay mum on their own pricing plans?  

If 2K is any indicator, not long.
