[Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk&t=1s) from Nintendo

[[Nintendo has big plans for Super Mario Bros.’ 35th anniversary – VGC|Sometimes, having hope pans out]].

Nintendo sure is acting like Nintendo with some of these Mario 35th anniversary announcements. A *Super Mario Bros.* 35-player battle royale, *Tetris 99* style? [Great idea](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/super-mario-battle-royale-game-shut-down/)! Let’s only allow people play until March 2021. So Nintendo.

Let’s take three iconic 3D *Super Mario* games and put them in a single collection for Switch. Swell plan! Let’s also only offer it both physically *and* digitally until March 2021! Why not?

It would not surprise me if after this March 2021 deadline if Nintendo sells these ports individually and digitally only. Maybe sometime next summer there will be some sort of N64 or GameCube or even Wii virtual console for Switch?

This may also help paint a picture for Nintendo’s plans for *The Legend of Zelda* and *Metroid*’s 35th anniversaries, both of which are next year (but who am I kidding, Metroid will get bupkis). There have been rumors of [a port of *Skyward Sword* for Switch](https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-skyward-sword-nintendo-switch-port-leak-amazon) for quite a while now. During the Wii U generation, both *Wind Waker* and *Twilight Princess* got full HD ports, so I doubt there is a triple pack with those games. Maybe the sequel to *Breath of the Wild* will release, possibly alongside [[Nintendo Plans Upgraded Switch Console and Major Games for 2021 – Bloomberg|a new, more powerful Switch]]?

Speculation and confusion aside, it is great to see *Super Mario 3D All-Stars* in action and to be able to play in just two weeks! I think this quick turnaround from official announcement to release is a blast. It is a shame we have to wait until February 2021 for *Super Mario 3D World*+ though.
