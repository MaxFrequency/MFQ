It seems that leaking the actual console design, price point, and release date was the [leak that broke the dam](https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1303213264441024514). After [Windows Central reported](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-and-xbox-series-s-release-date-and-price-finally-revealed) that the Xbox Series X and S would release on November 10 at $500 and $300, respectively [Xbox decided to confirm the Series S’ existence, design, and $300 price tag](https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1303230071033880576). They have remained mum on the Series X pricing and the release date.

[The Series S is all-digital, supports raytracing, 1440p up to 120fps, 4K upscaling for games, 4K media playback, and has a 512GB SSD](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426947/microsoft-xbox-series-s-specs-pricing-release-date-trailer-leak). No other specs were officially revealed, but since the Series S has been one of, if not the, worst kept secret for this upcoming generation, I think it is safe to bet on the [previously leaked specs](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1295638725272141825).

The key differences between the Series X and S lie in the GPU, RAM, output, and storage. The GPU is reported as having less than half the compute units (20 CUs vs the Series X’s 52 CUs) and only a third of the teraflops with 4TF instead of 12TF. The RAM is reportedly only 10GBs of GDDR6 instead of the Series X’s 16 GB. The Series X does have an interesting combination of RAM though, with 10 GB at a speed of 560 GB/s and the remaining 6 GB at 336 GB/s. I wonder if the Series S’ RAM will be at 560 GB/s or 336 GB/s.

I find the more interesting comparison for the Series S is between it and the [Xbox One X](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-one-x-specs). While the CPU and GPU are less powerful on the One X, its GPU does have 40 CUs and 6TF. The One X has 12 GB of GDDR5 RAM at 326 GB/s. It also outputs full 4K gameplay, instead of upscaling it and comes with a disc drive. Unfortunately, the [[Microsoft discontinues Xbox One X and Xbox One SAD – The Verge|Xbox One X was discontinued in July 2020]].

The $300 price tag is going to grab a lot of people’s attention. It will definitely look better on the shelf next to both the PS5 and the Series X, especially when an electronics department employee is giving a weak pitch. Parents and kids will snag these up quickly. I am curious how the different specs will impact performance and development. Microsoft has promised cross-generational support for many of their games. This adds one more combination of hardware to the mix. Despite all the hemming and hawing surrounding the PS5’s price and date, Sony does have clearing messaging between its two PS5 variants: One has a disc drive, the other does not, otherwise the two boxes are identical. While this won’t lead to a price gap like the Series X and S have, it does make for a cleaner message.

On the flip side, having a price tag of $300 is a much louder message.
