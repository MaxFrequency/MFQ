# Invisible GameCube – BitHead1000

[Invisible GameCube – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ap0ppx6P8&t=919s) by BitHead1000

Another YouTube recommendation winner. While I’m not a fan of how the rest of BitHead1000 presents their videos after scrolling through them, but this one is just a time lapse of a rad construction project.

It actually reminds me of a neighbor kid from down the street when I was in elementary school. It was before I owned my own GameCube and I wanted one extremely bad. He said that his dad worked for the manufacturing company that made GameCubes — in central Indiana. I totally bought the lie and he promised we could get a custom GameCube for myself. I wanted a transparent one. I (obviously) never got it.
