# Maddy Myers Leaves Kotaku

[The Galaxy Is At Peace](https://kotaku.com/the-galaxy-is-at-peace-1843128956) by Maddy Myers for Kotaku

Kotaku now has a [staff of 15 people](https://kotaku.com/about). This is just shy of two weeks after [[Jason Schreier Leaves Kotaku|Jason Schreier left Kotaku]]. Both Jason and Maddy have a new [podcast](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/) with Kotaku alum Kirk Hamilton. The three of them were the hosts of Kotakuâ€™s Splitscreen podcast. Maddy says she has a new job at another media outlet that she will reveal later. Jason ended up a Bloomberg.

Unfortunately, I feel like the writing is on the wall for Kotaku.

Update (5/11/20): Maddy is now a [senior games editor at Polygon](https://twitter.com/MIDImyers/status/1259853660772864008).
