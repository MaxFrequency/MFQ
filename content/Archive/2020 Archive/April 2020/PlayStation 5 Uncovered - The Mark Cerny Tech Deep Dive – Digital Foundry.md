# PlayStation 5 Uncovered - The Mark Cerny Tech Deep Dive – Digital Foundry

[PlayStation 5 uncovered: the Mark Cerny tech deep dive](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-playstation-5-the-mark-cerny-tech-deep-dive)  by Richard Leadbetter for Digital Foundry

The folks at Digital Foundry are known for their deep dives, but I won’t lie, this stuff is deep. The bits I did understand were exciting. Richard’s own excitement is contagious. It’s definitely worth looking into if you are chomping at the bit for more PS5 news.

I wrote about the [[The King of Custom – PS5 Specs Revealed|PS5’s spec reveal]] two weeks ago. Both the PS5 and the Xbox Series X sound super exciting. Eager to get my hands on both this Holiday.
