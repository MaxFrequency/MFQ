# Sony has Delayed The Last of Us Part II Indefinitely

>Update: SIE has made the difficult decision to delay the launch of The Last of Us Part II and Marvelâ€™s Iron Man VR until further notice. Logistically, the global crisis is preventing us from providing the launch experience our players deserve.

It was [only a matter of time](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1240805572976525314) given the current global climate concerning COVID-19. It is the right call.

[Jason Schreier reports](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1245789672007221248) that the game was on track for its May release. Naughty Dog made a statement providing a bit of context. The decision was made for the safety of all involved and to make sure their game was released simultaneously for all fans to enjoy the game. Sony did upload some new screen shots of the game, but then oddly removed them later in the afternoon. My pal Logan downloaded them and [published them on DualShockers](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-screenshots-joel/), if you care to look.

The interesting bit of conversation is how it impacts Ghost of Tsushima. Will it also be delayed? Or will The Last of Us Part II be released after Ghost of Tsushima? Sony has no other future delay announcements to make at this time. Iron Man VR was also delayed alongside The Last of us Part II. You better believe this will be a part of [[Announcing Chasing the Stick|Chasing the Stick]].
