# Phil Spencer Plays The Initiative’s Game

[The Initiative’s Upcoming Game is in a Playable State, Phil Spencer Goes Hands-On](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-initiative-phil-spencer-xbox-series-x/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) by Logan Moore at DualShockers

Turns out that [[Phil Spencer Visits The Initiative|Phil’s recent visit to The Initiative]] was not a one time deal before the launch of next gen. Design Director [Drew Murray tweeted](https://twitter.com/PlaidKnuckles/status/1225144643509092352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) out a picture of Phil playing some sort of build of their game on February 5, 2020. If The Initiative’s game is far enough along to be playable, I imagine [[Big Three Predictions 2020|a reveal could easily happen this year]].
