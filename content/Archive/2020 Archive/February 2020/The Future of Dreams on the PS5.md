# The Future of Dreams on the PS5

[PS5 is ‘an obvious progression’ for Dreams, says creative director | VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dreams-ps5-version-release-media-molecule/) by Tom Ivan via [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/dreams-on-ps5-is-the-obvious-next-step-if-its-successful)

>You know, [Dreams] it’s a platform, so ideally in the future we’ll migrate to whatever is relevant. That’s probably about as much as I can say without getting smacked by someone. 
>– Mark Healey, Media Molecule co-founder in an interview with VGC

[[Is PlayStation Entering the Video Game Engine Business|Perhaps migrate it as an engine for developers to use?]] Allow licensing so devs can sell their games made with Dreams?

>I would actually hope that it extends the life of the PS4 to be honest with you, then maybe when other companies start making games for it, the community will carry on making games for it, but if it’s as successful as we hope it is then it’s an obvious progression.

Other companies? Making games in/with Dreams? [I imagine they’d like to make money too](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21136244/dreams-ps4-game-creation-tool-exposure-problem-curation-media-molecule). There sure is a lot of buzz around Dreams now that it has been released worldwide. I think the future is bright for that game and its engine.
