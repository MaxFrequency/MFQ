# Shuhei Yoshida and a Decade of Dreams

[Shuhei Yoshida: A Decade of Dreams? – PS I Love You XOXO Ep. 4 — PS I Love You XOXO — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+HTm4KAgZY/1:31:24)

I think Greg and Blessing flirt right on the edge of my idea that Dreams could become an engine that PlayStation distributes, like [[Is PlayStation Entering the Video Game Engine Business|I wrote about this week]]. The article they mentioned from [Stephen Tailby at PushSquare](http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2020/01/sonys_shuhei_yoshida_describes_dreams_as_a_ten_year_project)quotes Shuhei Yoshida from the recent Impy Awards celebrating Dreams creations. You can see [Shuhei’s statement on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/542185187?t=01h41m14s). I think the quote below lends itself the most to my theory and makes it feel like a slam dunk. 

> I cannot wait to see how this platform develops, and how this tool will enable the future creators of video games that everybody will enjoy.

Maybe I am just hearing what I want to hear, but there is definitely more to Dreams and its Bubblebath engine than meets the eye.
