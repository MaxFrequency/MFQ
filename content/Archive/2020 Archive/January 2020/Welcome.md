# Welcome

Max Frequency is a website for my ideas to find a home. [280 characters](https://www.twitter.com/maxroberts143) is not always enough. Writing for other sites provides pressures to output articles at an expected, often accelerated pace. Max Frequency solves both those problems for me.

Over the past year, I’ve ventured outside my typical news and gaming consumption and discovered podcasts, websites, and (most importantly) people I care to listen to. Starting a new job in 2019 with a total commute of 10+ hours a week, encouraged me to find a flood of staggered weekly podcasts. My commutes are often the highlights of my week thanks to my new discoveries of shows like [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected), [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/), [Giant Bombcast](https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/giant-bombcast/), and [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/).

This influx of podcast consumption has led to more reading of blogs and seeking multiple perspectives on the news I care about. And all of this has kicked my various ideas in a note on my phone into a reality. I’m stubborn though and hate starting projects without a name: And I find that naming something is the hardest part of any project.

I like what I came up with—Max Frequency. It communicates the identity of the blog quite well, I think. It’s me at my frequency. No pressures for deadlines, no list of required news. Only articles that I want to write or share. It also opens up the possibility for audio content if I ever get behind the mic again. Plus, it is a pun.

I hope you enjoy what I write here. I’ve never owned a website before. I think having skin in the game will motivate me. I want to thank my wife Abby for encouraging me to make this and having my back the whole way. I love you.
