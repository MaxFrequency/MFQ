Glad to see [this book](https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/iwata-san-hobonichis-book-on-satoru-iwata-will-be-translated-into-english/) is finally being brought West. The five year anniversary of Satoru Iwata’s passing just passed on July 11. After Steve Jobs, Iwata is the first CEO I ever truly recall being able to identify. He always struck me as a gentle, quirky person that was an effective leader and shaped Nintendo for generations to come, not just in the console sense of the word.
