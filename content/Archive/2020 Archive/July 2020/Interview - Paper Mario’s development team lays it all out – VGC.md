# Interview - Paper Mario’s development team lays it all out – VGC

[Interview: Paper Mario’s development team lays it all out](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/paper-mario-origami-king/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) by Andy Robinson for VGC

> “Games are entertainment, so I want the people who play our games to say ‘Wow!’ My understanding is that if we want to give players these positive surprises, we can’t do exactly the same thing that’s been done before.”
> 
> Risa Tabata, Nintendo EPD’s assistant producer

> “However, I do think it’s difficult to satisfy certain fans with the adventure game direction if they think of *Paper Mario* games as simply being RPGs. I hope that everyone will play this game with an open mind.”
> 
> Kensuke Tanabe, Senior Officer Nintendo EPD

When you want something to return to form after nearly 16 years, it’s tough to hear this sentiment from the creators. I am glad that the team gets to make the game they want to. I respect that vision and I am still excitedly curious to see what *Paper Mario* looks like in 2020 (*The Origami King* will be my first new *Paper Mario* game since 2007), but I am still bummed out that *The Origami King* does not appear to be the kind of game I truly want. Maybe someday *The Thousand Year Door* will escape its imprisonment on the GameCube and be ported to modern hardware.
