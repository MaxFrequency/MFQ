# Introducing a new and improved Twitter API

[Introducing a new and improved Twitter API](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html)

> …here’s what we will say: developers play a key role in building the future of Twitter. The new API is going to help us better serve all of you. And we are so excited to get it to you soon.

Two years ago Twitter [killed major features](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17699626/twitter-third-party-apps-streaming-api-deprecation) in third-party apps by removing and limiting API support. It was a sad day for many diehard Twitter users, myself included. I still use [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) and have for nearly a decade now. Hopefully Twitter brings back true third-party support with a more full-featured and developer-friendly API.
