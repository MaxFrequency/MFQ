# A Closer Look at Paper Mario - The Origami King – Nintendo

I am so torn on *Paper Mario: The Origami King* after this in-depth preview. Nintendo seems to be listening, but only partially. Companions are there, but appear generic and may not have a significant role in combat. Bosses are unfortunately directly inspired by *Sticker Star* and *Color Splash*. Combat looks intriguing: There is certainly a strategic element, but could be bloated. I wish Nintendo would ignore the paper craft element outside of visuals. The combat and narrative do not need to be directly influenced by paper.

Color me cautiously optimistic…
