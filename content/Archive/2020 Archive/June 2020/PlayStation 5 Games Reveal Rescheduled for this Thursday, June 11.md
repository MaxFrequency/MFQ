# PlayStation 5 Games Reveal Rescheduled for this Thursday, June 11

[UPDATED TIME: This Thursday, See the Future of Gaming on PS5 – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/08/updated-time-this-thursday-see-the-future-of-gaming-on-ps5/)

> Hi all – thanks for being patient and understanding while we rescheduled this PS5 event for Thursday, June 11 at 1pm Pacific Time / 9pm BST. We needed to step aside so key voices could be heard during this historic and important time.

The [[PlayStation 5 Event Announced for June 4|original broadcast]] was scheduled for June 4 at the same time. It was postponed due to the [[Sony Postpones PS5 Event due to Nationwide Protests|protests happening nationwide]]. 

> Now that the event is confirmed for June 11, I wanted to add that this pre-taped program will be broadcast at 1080p and 30 frames per second. This eased the show’s production process during a time when many of our team and developers are working from home. The games you’ll see on Thursday will look even better when you play them on PS5 with a 4K TV, as you’d expect. 
> 
> It’s also best if you watch while wearing headphones, if you can — there’s some cool audio work in the show, and it might be harder to appreciate if it’s pumped through your phone or laptop speakers.

I am pumped to finally see some PS5 games in action. I think it is quite smart of them to tease cool audio work via headphones. This is a main feature of the PS5 and to offer some sort of tease for that tech is the right move. 

As for the resolution and frame rate, full 4K versions of the footage will probably be released after the stream. Nothing to worry about there. Let the next gen cycle begin!
