# Supercade - A Visual History of the Videogame Age 1985-2001 by Van Burnham — Kickstarter

[Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age 1985-2001 by Van Burnham — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vanburnham/supercade-a-visual-history-of-the-videogame-age-1985-2001)

Full disclosure: I am a backer of this project. It was fully funded within five hours.

This just seems like a super cool project. I am a huge lover of visual books. Whether it’s a [game’s art book](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-uncharted-4-book-features-never-before-seen-ar/1100-6436097/), a [chronological collection of game consoles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593277431/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_WkQ1Eb3NCSG4R), or [arcade game font](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0500021740/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_MlQ1EbPG74JMF), when it comes to video games, I love big, beautiful, visual books.

It’s an added bonus that it covers the years of gaming that I grew up in. Stoked to get this in hand next year.
