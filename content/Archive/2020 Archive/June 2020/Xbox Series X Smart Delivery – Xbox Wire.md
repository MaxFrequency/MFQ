# Xbox Series X Smart Delivery – Xbox Wire

[Xbox Series X: Buy A Game Once and Play the Best Version Across Generations with Smart Delivery – Xbox Wire](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/06/15/what-is-smart-delivery-xbox-series-x/)

Microsoft continues the trend of transparent, concise, consumer-friendly language detailing Xbox Series X features. They actually have a list of currently supported games or crying out loud.

- *Halo Infinite* 
- *Cyberpunk 2077* 
- *Assassin’s Creed Valhalla* 
- *Destiny 2* 
- *DiRT 5* 
- *Scarlet Nexus* 
- *Chorus* 
- *Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2* 
- *Yakuza: Like a Dragon* 
- *The Ascent* 
- *Call of the Sea* 
- *Gears 5* 
- *Second Extinction* 
- *Metal: Hellslinger* 

Not a long list, by any means, but it will undoubtedly grow in July when Microsoft reveals their slew of games for the Series X. The next-gen console wars are just beginning.
