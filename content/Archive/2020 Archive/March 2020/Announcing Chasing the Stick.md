# Announcing Chasing the Stick

![[noart_logo_300dpi_small-mf-logo-1.jpg.webp]]
I’ve been writing the history of Naughty Dog during the PS4 era. It is far and away the largest editorial I have ever written. I’ve been working on it for a month now ([two months if you count replaying the Uncharted series in my research](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1224484769997651968)) and still have another two to go, if *The Last of Us Part II* releases on time in May. I’ve wigged out my pal Logan by sharing the ever increasing word count.

It started out as “I should write a history on *The Last of Us Part II*.” Not an entirely foreign format for myself: I wrote a history on [[The History of Breath of the Wild|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] and [[The Legacy and History of Nintendo's Super Smash Bros.|one for Super Smash Bros.]] before *Ultimate* released. I love chronicling and researching games. I’ve been doing it since I made Power Points to convince my parents I was old enough to play *Zelda* and *Pokémon*.

My curiosity swelled my ambition. So it has turned into a history, analysis, and commentary on my all-time favorite game studio and their development during the years 2013-2020. I can’t wait to share it with you around the time *The Last of Us Part II* releases. Thanks.
