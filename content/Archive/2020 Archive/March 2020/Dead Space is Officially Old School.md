# Dead Space is Officially Old School

During the “[Road to PS5](https://maxfrequency.net/2020/03/20/ps5-specs-revealed/)” presentation, Mark Cerny used *Dead Space* as an example to discuss spatial audio. [Mark called one of horror’s best “old school.”](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sg&t=2488) *Dead Space* came out in October 2008. I was 14. Am I old school?
