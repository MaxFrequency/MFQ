# How Stealth Game Guards See and Hear - School of Stealth – GMTK

[How Stealth Game Guards See and Hear | School of Stealth – YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ay-5g36oFfc) by Mark Brown at Game Maker’s Toolkit

I love a good ol’ fashioned deep dive into game design with Mark. Stealth is a genre near and dear to me. The way Mark breaks down the basics of enemy AI detection is a fun start to this mini-series. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
