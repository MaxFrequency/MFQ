I have heard great stuff about Craig and HBOâ€™s *Chernobyl* series last year. I actually just picked it up on sale as some homework. I know *The Last of Us* movie was in production turmoil. A television series makes so much more sense for adapting a video game. I wonder what sort of lessons and challenges there will be adapting a story told so heavily via gameplay to a more passive medium like TV. Gameplay lets players develop a stronger sense of empathy and identity. The show has a unique challenge ahead of itself.
