Update (06/05/2020): It is live.

*Chasing the Stick* is the story of video game developer Naughty Dog. It tells how they make their games with the unified goal of telling the story on the joystick. From *The Last of Us* to the PS5, Chasing the Stick tells the story of one of the video game industry’s most renowned and prolific developers.

A couple of months ago at the end of March 2020, [[Announcing Chasing the Stick|I announced this new project called Chasing the Stick]]. It would be the definitive history of Naughty Dog and their time working on the PlayStation 4. Covering the years 2013-2020, I have researched, analyzed, and critiqued the catalog that Naughty Dog has developed within one console generation. My transcription skills have gotten pretty good, if I do say so myself.

The end of the project is in sight. I plan to click the publish button on June 5, 2020. I chose that date for two reasons: It happens to be two weeks before the release of *The Last of Us Part II* and it also happens to be my birthday.

*Chasing the Stick* has turned into more than a lengthy editorial for my website. I have also turned it into an e-book and audiobook. It has been completely self-produced and published.

It will also be entirely free.

You will be able to download the e-book as a .epub or .mobi file. These can be added to your phone or Kindle reader quite easily. The audiobook will be available as a podcast through major podcast providers and as a direct download. I narrated the entire audiobook. It is the same experience no matter where you read (or listen) to Chasing the Stick. Everything will be available on [MaxFrequency.net](https://www.maxfrequency.net).

*Chasing the Stick* is part essay, part research, part history, part editorial, and part critical analysis. It is a celebration of my favorite video game developer. I’ve channeled all my excitement and energy for *The Last of Us Part II* into this story over the past four months. I cannot wait to share this all with you.
