# Ghost of Tsushima - Your Questions Answered – PlayStation.Blog

[Ghost of Tsushima: Your Questions Answered – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/05/29/ghost-of-tsushima-your-questions-answered/)

Reading through this Q&A, I was wondering if these really did come from social media or if they were a more carefully curated list of questions. Then I read this one:

> Fantastic gameplay, however could you perhaps look at changing the physics of an arrow headshot? The backwards force was a tad unrealistic and over the top, otherwise an excellent demonstration!

The bowshot in question can be seen [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ur0pQblaZcE&t=625). Good gracious people, it’s a video game about being a badass samurai. Let the longbow pop people back if Sucker Punch wants it to behave that way.

I digress.

The whole Q&A does a great job of providing more details about *Ghost of Tsushima*. Sony is being more aggressive with marketing and preview coverage now that their two big tittles are weeks away.

> **Q: Does choosing to fight like a Samurai or like a Ghost/Ninja have consequences? Was thinking it might be like the Good/Evil karma system?**
> 
> Nate: There is no karma system. There’s one story we’re telling here, one journey for Jin.
> 
> As for the player making a choice, we want to be clear that there isn’t a binary choice for the player, it’s more about the player having freedom to play through any encounter in the style they prefer and wearing whichever armor they prefer, mixing and matching pieces of different armor sets. Your actions also aren’t limited by your armor – for example, you may have seen that the “Standoff” prompt appeared even in the Ghost section. You can still use tools like Smoke Bombs even if you’re wearing samurai armor. As we showed in the State of Play, that one scenario with the Shipyard played out very differently based on how the player approached the situation.

Sucker Punch’s choice to showcase the same encounter two different ways seems to have led to lots of confusion about what kinds of gameplay decisions people will actually have. [[Ghost of Tsushima Preview|I was confused about the narrative implications]], but once the [[How the Studio Behind The Last Guardian Helped Ghost of Tsushima Find Its Direction – USgamer|lack of a karma system was confirmed]], those gameplay concerns melted away. I think showing off gameplay off using both styles would help quite a bit.

> Nate: Some have watched the State of Play footage and concluded that *Ghost of Tsushima* is an easy game, which isn’t the case. Combat is designed to be lethal both ways, not just for the player versus enemies. Jin’s foes can definitely take him out quickly, too.
> 
> The gameplay we showed was captured by one of the test leads on Ghost, and he’s very skilled with the katana. Plus, Jin had some abilities unlocked that he doesn’t begin the game with. We wanted to show what combat can look like when the player has mastered the controls and abilities — when Jin is at his best. We think most will find the combat satisfyingly challenging.

Why would players want to see someone lose? Of course Sucker Punch chose a person that is very skilled at combat to demo the game. Why did Bruce Straley demo *The Last of Us* and *Uncharted 4*? Because he is good at the game! The Souls-like genre has made action fans masochists. I have zero doubts that *Ghost of Tsushima* will offer people a good challenge.

> **Q: Will it feature different endings based on the fighting style the players use more often (Samurai or Ghost)?**
> 
> Nate: The game tells the human story about Jin’s sacrifice to become the Ghost. Players can choose to primarily fight with a sword, bow or stealth; either way Jin becomes a legend to the people of Tsushima, and a terror to the Mongol Invaders.

I may be concerned with possible gameplay mechanics lining up with the revenge-focused narrative, but I am super down with this game’s story premise.

> **Q: How long is the game?**
> 
> …Let’s put it another way: Most of our play testers would spend a full week on Ghost and not finish the storyline. We know everyone wants a number, but we’re confident to say that if you want a satisfying story in a big, content-rich world with lots to do and see and lots of characters to get to know, you’ll find what you’re looking for in *Ghost of Tsushima*.

If the mechanics and structure in place have a satisfying and addictive loop, this sounds great. If the game is shallower than I expect, it may feel like it over stays its welcome. I am confident in Sucker Punch though. They’ve been making open world games (arguably) since the PS2 with *Sly Cooper*. For purists of the definition, then they have been at it since the beginning of the PS3 generation with inFamous. Sucker Punch knows open world game design.

> Q: Will we be able to dual-wield both swords at the same time while attacking?
> 
> Nate: No, Jin was trained to fight with a single sword in a traditional style.

Gotta have some [new feature for the sequel](http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/halo-2/528851p5.html).
