# Paper Mario - The Origami King Announced, Out in Two Months

[Paper Mario: The Origami King – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX6DTLcWUdY)

That trailer shows all the right things. As a *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* fan from the beginning, this looks so right. Unique characters, no silly stickers or human-objects, possible partners: This looks like the *Paper Mario* I fell in love with. With it being out in two months (on the same day as *Ghost of Tsushima*), this is an exciting turnaround. My hopes have been lifted once again.

Please, please be the return to form that the series deserves. Please.
