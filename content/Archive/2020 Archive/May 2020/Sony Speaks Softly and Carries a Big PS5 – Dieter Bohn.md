# Sony Speaks Softly and Carries a Big PS5 – Dieter Bohn

[Why Amazon’s hardware makes more sense than Google’s](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258285/amazon-google-hardware-strategy-tablets-android-pixel-angst-drama) by Dieter Bohn for The Verge

> Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says the PS5 is so impressive it’s ‘going to help drive future PCs’. He is very impressed. When I first saw reports of fast storage, I thought it was just about faster load times. It’s clearly about so much more.

> “We’ve been working super close with Sony for quite a long time on storage,” he says. “The storage architecture on the PS5 is far ahead of anything you can buy on anything on PC for any amount of money right now. It’s going to help drive future PCs. (The PC market is) going to see this thing ship and say, ‘Oh wow, SSDs are going to need to catch up with this.’”

While not the main point of Dieter’s newsletter, I found the headline of this section enticing. Yesterday’s [[Unreal Engine 5 Revealed with a Real-Time Demo Running on PlayStation 5|reveal of Unreal Engine 5]] being exclusively paired to the PS5 name is a tremendous boost to PS5’s appearance. Unreal is a multiplatform engine though and this was an exclusively built tech demo to showcase the new engine’s technology. Unreal should perform the same on the Xbox Series X.

> “We consider things strategically but doing our best,” said Totoki, reports [Bloomberg’s Takashi Mochizuki](https://twitter.com/6d6f636869/status/1260497105933787138). “As for pass or fail, I would wait for PS5 sales to make that judgement.”

Sony’s R&D into the SSD and custom I/O sounds like it will pay off not just for the PS5, but the PC market as well. Competition keeps things healthy. This is part of why I prefer console gaming. The hardware is tailored for the experience. This is why first party studios get such great results. Look at the Switch and games like *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* or *Super Mario Odyssey*. Nintendo has some of the generation’s best looking and optimized games on technically weaker hardware. Intimate knowledge of a console can lead to fantastic results. I am eager to see both what Sony and Microsoft cook up this generation.
