# IO Interactive is Making a 007 Game

[Project 007 – Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slAhuh21ii8&feature=youtu.be)

No wonder the *Hitman* trilogy is ending in two months. I’d be bouncing off the walls to make a 007 game.

Fun fact: The last 007 game was release in 2012. It easily could be a decade by the time this project is released.
