# DF Retro EX Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 – Digital Foundry

[DF Retro EX: Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 – A Brilliant Remake of a Classic Gaming Series!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybQv1nfAEr0&t=1685s) by John Linneman for Digital Foundry

This is a stellar look at the actual history of *Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater* and its sequel. I never knew there were so many ports! I grew up solely on the N64 port of the first game: I still have my blue cartridge that my Dad bought at a garage sale in the neighborhood. I would find [tricks](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/199059-tony-hawks-pro-skater/faqs/16795) and [cheat codes](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/n64/199059-tony-hawks-pro-skater/cheats) on GameFAQs and play for hours in front of our tiny CRT in the basement. I’m stoked to pick up these remakes down the line.
