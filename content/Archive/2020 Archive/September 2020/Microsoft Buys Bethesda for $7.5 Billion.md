[Welcoming the Talented Teams and Beloved Game Franchises of Bethesda to Xbox](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/) by Phil Spencer for Xbox Wire

Microsoft is buying ZeniMax Media (Bethesdaâ€™s parent company) for $7.5 billion. This means Xbox now owns *Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Starfield, Wolfenstein, Dishonored*, and much, much more. 

Disney [bought](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/10/30/disney-star-wars-lucasfilm/1669739/) Star Wars for $4.05 billion in 2012, which would apparently be [$4.5 billion today](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2012?amount=4000000000).
