[Pixel FX](https://www.pixelfx.co/)

The dream team of [@citrus3000psi](https://twitter.com/citrus3000psi), [@chriz2600](https://twitter.com/chriz2600), and [@woozle64](https://twitter.com/Woozle64) have come together and formed Pixel FX. Alongside the announcement of their company together, the team has along announced a new N64 HDMI mod that will launch in April 2021. The N64Digital seems to be a direct competitor to the extremely difficult to acquire Ultra HDMI 64. With the track record behind these three, I imagine the N64Digital will have better stock over time.

The initial results [look incredible](https://www.pixelfx.co/images/mario.png).

Citrus3000psi and Chriz2600 have worked together on the [[PS1Digital Review, HDMI for PlayStation 1 – Digital Foundry|PS1Digital]], which looks slick. I have been following Woozle’s work for years now with the GBA Consolizer and the [[DS Consolizer in the Works|DS Consolizer]]. Pixel FX sounds like a killer company to keep an eye on. I know I am excited for what these three will bring to retro hardware together.
