[Stuck in Cairo: A Story From The Development Of Rockstar’s Agent](https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2020/12/28/a-story-from-the-development-of-rockstars-agent) by Blake Hester for Game Informer

> During the development of Rockstar’s now long-missing spy game Agent, Rockstar San Diego project leader Luis Gigliotti had to do something far outside his typical job description: Call the United States Embassy in Cairo, Egypt. He needed help. A small team of artists – his fellow coworkers at Rockstar – were being held under house arrest in Cairo. Not only that, but the Egyptian authorities were also trying to pin the group with false charges of shooting pornography – a crime in the country. He needed assistance in getting them home safe.

> “And I’ll never forget, whoever it was on the call from the Embassy just literally said, ‘Are you guys stupid?'” Gigliotti tells me in a recent interview. “‘Whatever possessed you to think this was a good idea?'”

While *[Agent](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FetRGberIkw&t=3267)* has become a consistent joke and reference between my friends and myself, I am fascinated whenever a story about its development comes to light. Last year, Hester [wrote a brilliant look inside the mysterious game’s rocky, early development for Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/2/21/18118822/agent-rockstar-san-diego). Now at Game Informer, Hester has written up a smaller, but equally unique story about a one-off trip to Egypt to gather reference data for the dev team. Rock solid reporting all around that I find far too rare in the video game industry.

Always fun to think that somewhere out there, Rockstar has a build of this game for the PS3.
