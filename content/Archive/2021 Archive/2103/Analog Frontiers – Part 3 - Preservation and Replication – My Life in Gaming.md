[ANALOG FRONTIERS – Part 3: Preservation and Replication MY LIFE IN GAMING – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt3WyfMffX0)

I have been waiting for Part 3 of *Analog Frontiers* for quite a bit. No fault of My Life in Gaming; I have just been excited to see where Coury and Try take their documentary series. Part 3 is all about preservation and replication, which I take to mean a serious dive into FPGA emulation, clone consoles, the MiSTer, software emulation, and so on. This premise alone has countless ways to go and I am super stoked to watch.
