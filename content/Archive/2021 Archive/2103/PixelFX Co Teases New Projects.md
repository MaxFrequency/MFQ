The trio over at PixelFX Co is insane. Before the team has shipped the N64Digital, they are [teasing](https://twitter.com/PixelFXco/status/1372284755413192708) a GameCube project, a PS2Digital, and what appears to be (to my eye) an upscaler akin to the OSSC or the Retrotink 5X.

This also comes hot off the heels of the reveal of custom [zooming and cropping](https://twitter.com/PixelFXco/status/1371841147476312064) features in the N64Digital.

I really need to bite the bullet and start to learn soldering. These projects seem incredible. And those PlayStation oriented ones could come in handy for [[Chasing the Stick - The Book â€“ Here I Go Again|my book about Naughty Dog]].
