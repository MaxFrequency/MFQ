Maybe Your ‘Pile Of Shame’ Is A Problem – [[Maybe Your ‘Pile Of Shame’ Is A Problem – Kotaku|A Short-Sighted Take from Kotaku]]  

Game Pass provides its subscribers access to hundreds of games.  

Games that they don’t own. Games they will never have time to play all of. Games that come and go as contracts and deals expire.  

I suppose paying $15 a month for instant access to a game library is foolish then, by Luke Plunkett’s logic.  

> It doesn’t matter if that’s $15 you were never going to spend, there’s a button being pressed inside our brains that says hey, this is a lot cheaper than it used to be, get it, because you’re saving and saving is smart. Not like those idiots who paid full price at release. (Subscribe to) it.  

[Right](https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1303195573080653824)?

> I know that’s a radical suggestion, but you’ll be OK. You’ll get through this. We live in a digital world. Those games are going to go on sale again, and they’re never going to run out of stock. Enjoy the games you’ve got and are still playing!

> Games exist to serve one purpose: to be played. If you’re buying them and not playing them, maybe you’re doing it wrong.
