[PlayStation May Have Previously Worked on Remakes of Uncharted and God of War](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/playstation-uncharted-god-of-war-remake-ps4-ps5/) by Logan Moore for Comicbook

> Speaking to David Jaffe, the previous director of titles like *God of War* and *Twisted Metal*, Michael Mumbauer, a former head at Sony San Diego Studio, talked a bit about what his role was at the developer while he was there. Mumbauer’s main position at first was to lead a visual arts group that would provide support to other Sony studios, but over time, this began to change.

This article was published nearly four months ago.

Michael Mumbauer was a main focus of [[PlayStation’s Blockbuster Garden|this morning’s Bloomberg article]]. Turns out that remakes have been an idea floated around and worked on at Sony for some time now, inspired by remakes like the *Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy*. These were seemingly pursued by former President of Worldwide Studios, Shawn Layden. When Hermen Hulst came into the postion, it is even easier to imagine why he’d want to shift Mumbauer’s team off remaking *The Last of Us.* The cost of having a new team make a new engine just doesn’t make financial sense compared to them being a support group for the original development team to pursue a remake.

> “Remakes and remasters were the things I was chasing after. So that’s why the dev team was built,” Mumbauer said in the conversation. “What I can tell you is that’s what I was chasing because I believed that there was value in doing something like a remake of God of War at the visual fidelity of today. Or, a remake of Uncharted 1 at the visual fidelity of today.”

These plans have been in the works for many months, more likely years, as Sony observes, plans, and reacts to the market. Like I said this morning, the fruits of this work is going to take time to see. Obviously, finding out about this was not what Sony wanted. This would have been a surprise reveal at some event. Now the story is out and we just have to wait and see how and if Sony reacts.

I also feel bad for the team working on this supposed remake. Hopefully, they have excited about their work and remaking one of gaming’s best titles for an incredibly powerful system. It has immense potential to be a wonderful product. Heck, imagine if they remade Factions multiplayer with it. Now their project can’t officially be talked about and its name is being dragged through the mud. It’s rather unfortunate all the way around.
