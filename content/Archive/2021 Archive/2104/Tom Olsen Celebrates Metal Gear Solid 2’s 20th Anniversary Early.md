I highly recommend starting at the beginning and following the month-long journey. What a perfectly Kojima-inspired way to celebrate *Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty*. And, honestly, a good look at how the message of the game still rings true to this day.

I have really enjoyed following the Big Shell Incident through Tom’s eyes. Maybe I’ll [[Returning to Shadow Moses — My Journey back through Metal Gear Solid|revisit the Big Shell]] myself before too long.
