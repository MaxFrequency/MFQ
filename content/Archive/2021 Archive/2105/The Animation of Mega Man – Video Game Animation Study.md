[The Animation of Mega Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvWH-3aBymg) by Video Game Animation Study on YouTube

An extremely insightful and fun look at how Mega Manâ€™s movement and animation has and has not changed in 30 years. I really enjoyed the wide range of games, remakes, ports, and whatnot that they looked at in this study. I was surprised that *Mega Man 9* and *Mega Man 10* were not included, but that could be due to the fact Capcom co-developed those games with Inti Creates. Nevertheless, there is a rich well of animation history to dig through here. It was a blast to watch while work videos exported.
