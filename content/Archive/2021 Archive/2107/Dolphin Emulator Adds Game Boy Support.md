[Dolphin Emulator – mGBA Integration: Introducing the Integrated GBA](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2021/07/21/integrated-gba/)

> Your eyes are not deceiving you. As of 5.0-14690, Dolphin now has mGBA directly built into it as a new way to handle Game Boy Advance connectivity with GameCube titles. For those who don’t know, mGBA is the most renowned and accurate GBA emulator of this era and has been rapidly improving since its inception…
> 
> By bringing these two emulators together in one package, GBA connectivity features now work with popular features like savestates, input recordings, and netplay! All of this comes with the added bonus of improved performance and compatibility.

Between this and the recently released [2P GBA core for the MiSTer project](https://www.retrorgb.com/2-player-gb-gbc-gba-custom-cores-for-mister.html), my childhood is getting such love and proper treatment in the emulation scene. I am stoked! I already downloaded the beta and began fiddling around with the functionality.
