[Sacred Symbols+, Episode 105: The Blue Box Conspiracy](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-53934629) by Last Stand Media on Patreon

I throughly enjoyed the deep dive into the possible evidence about [[What’s Going on with Blue Box Game Studios? – PlayStation Lifestyle|Blue Box Game Studio]]. It’s behind the Patreon paywall, but this episode is an absolute treat! Colin and Dustin lay out all the tidbits and connect them with thoughtful conversation. I agree that *something* is up with Blue Box Game Studio and PlayStation. Theoretically, we’ll find out more in the coming weeks. Either way, I think this episode is absolutely worth the price of admission.
