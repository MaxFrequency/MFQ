The house from The Nightmare on Elm Street is for [sale](https://www.redfin.com/CA/Los-Angeles/1428-N-Genesee-Ave-90046/home/7116849). Normally, that’s enough to draw in the clicks and curiosity. Swiping through the pictures, [InformationTime2021 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/InformationTim1/status/1450990032416739336) pointed out that [[211021_inside-elm-house.jpg|the guest house]] was where Bo Burnham’s special *[Inside](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=inside&jbv=81289483)* was [[211021_inside-bo.jpeg|filmed]]. How about that?
