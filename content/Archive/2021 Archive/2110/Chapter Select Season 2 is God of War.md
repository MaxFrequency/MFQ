I am excited to announce that the focus of Chapter Select Season 2 is the *God of War* series. First appearing on the PlayStation 2 in 2005, *God of War*, Kratos, and the Blades of Chaos are still a proud titan within the PlayStation Studios catalog. *God of War* has arguably never been more relevant than with the upcoming ninth game, *God of War: Ragnarök* for PS4 and PS5, thanks to the series’ legendary relaunch in 2018.

You may have noticed a new link in the middle there — YouTube. I have decided to create a video version of Chapter Select going forward. I have to play the games anyway, why not capture them as I go along? I was actually recording gameplay of Season 1, Episode 1: Paper Mario, but lost some footage and then never picked it back up after a brief pause in production. Recording Sticker Star would have been tricky too. Thankfully, I have the means to capture all of the God of War games. You won’t see our faces: This allows me to use the same audio edit without odd cuts in the video. The gameplay will be what I actually did for the season, along with additional relevant clips woven in. I am very excited for folks to watch and listen to the show going forward.

As for this season’s slate of episodes, here is the order we have for Season 2:

- [[S2E1 - God of War|Episode 1: God of War (PlayStation 2)]], releasing on October 13, 2021.
- [[S2E2 - God of War - Ascension|Episode 2: God of War: Ascension (PlayStation 3)]], releasing on October 27, 2021.
- [[S2E4 - God of War - Ghost of Sparta|Episode 3: God of War II (PlayStation 2)]], releasing on November 10, 2021.
- [[S2E4 - God of War - Ghost of Sparta|Episode 4: God of War: Ghost of Sparta (PlayStation Portable)]], releasing on November 24, 2021.
- [[S2E5 - God of War - Chains of Olympus|Episode 5: God of War: Chains of Olympus (PlayStation Portable)]], releasing on December 8, 2021.
- [[S2E6 - God of War III|Episode 6: God of War III (PlayStation 3)]] releasing on December 22, 2021.
- [[S2E7 - God of War (2018)|Episode 7: God of War (2018) (PlayStation 4)]] releasing on January 5, 2022.
- [[S2E8 - God of War - Ragnarök Predictions|Episode 8: God of War: Ragnarök Predictions]]
- [[S2E9 - God of War - Ragnarök|Episode 9: God of War: Ragnarök (PlayStation 4/5)]]

“Why is *God of War* (2018) at the end of the season?” you may be asking yourself. We delve into this in the first episode, but Logan convinced me to go about Season 2 this way. Since the reboot/reimagining of *God of War* is so stark to the first six games, we agreed it’d be best to save the Norse iteration for the end. Plus, when *God of War: Ragnarök* comes out in 2022 (🤞🏻), we have a nice line-up throw in a new episode to the season.

Sorry *[God of War: Betrayal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War:_Betrayal)* fans, I couldn’t convince Logan to play it.

As far as the seasonal and episodic art, I spent a ton of energy finding real pictures that fit the themes and environments or each game. Nearly every photo was found on Unsplash and is properly credited in the show notes. Like [[S1 - Paper Mario|Season 1]]’s art, I have taken immense pride in the theming and visual design you’ll find in Season 2.

I hope you are as excited for Season 2: *God of War* as I am. The first two episodes will be launching next Wednesday, with new episodes following in a fortnightly manner. Subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts!
