[120+ Nintendo Switch Games Tested with Nintendo Switch Online Controllers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkdEPy3LcSs&t=5843s) by My Life in Gaming on YouTube

I may have [[The 2021 Controller Collection Update|57 of my own controllers]], including all the “Nintendo” Nintendo Switch Online controllers (sorry Sega), but My Life in Gaming knows how to *use* those controllers. This was a fun watch to explore controller compatibility.

My brain also focused on how the duo shot the video. Coury and Try are inspirations of mine, so I always find myself studying their camera work and edits. This video is mostly controllers and gameplay: When considering the sheer quantity of games tested, that could get visually dull. These guys nail it though and keep the variety fresh. [Look at this dope shot](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hkdEPy3LcSs&t=1222) of Coury looking at custom button mapping. I assume the camera is on a automated slider and he is haunched over it, but the end result is so cool and slick, even for just some menu navigation. Plenty of mental notes and lessons to take from this video.
