*[The Ethics of Revenge](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81345873?trackId=14170289&tctx=1%2C0%2C6d660756-9368-402e-b77c-100c2a408234-83626461%2C856bffa9-3bfa-4c3b-81f5-887043195837_50219555X3XX1640718508056%2C856bffa9-3bfa-4c3b-81f5-887043195837_ROOT%2C%2C%2C)* by Tony Zhou for Voir, S1E2 on Netflix

> Forever changed after seeing Park Chan-wook’s “Lady Vengeance,” Tony Zhou breaks down the uneasy perils and pleasures of revenge.

If you’re like me and have missed *[Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting)* by Tony Zhou and Taylor Ramos since its end five years ago, you need to watch [*Voir* on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80990130). This show is a collection of six video essays, three of which were [written and directed by the duo](https://twitter.com/tonyszhou/status/1467889634361233412). 

I plan on watching the whole season, but you know I started with the episode narrated by Tony himself.
