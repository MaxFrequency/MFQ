# Robert Kirkman Interviewed by My Friend Logan Moore

[Comicbook Nation season 3 Episode 15](https://megaphone.link/CBS5452773286 )

My dear friend and colleague Logan Moore had the wonderful opportunity to interview *Invincible* co-creator Robert Kirkman. Great questions from a [[Logan Mooreâ€™s Impressions of Invincible|fan of the comic series]] about how the show has been laid out so far. Plus, Logan shares his pitch for an *Invincible* video game.

My wife Abby keeps asking me when the next episode is out. She may end up reading the comics. This show has turned out better than I had even hoped for. So stoked for my friend to have the opportunity to interview one of his favorite creators. Dreams do come true.
