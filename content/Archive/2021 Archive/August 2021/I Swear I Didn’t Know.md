# I Swear I Didn’t Know

[[Death’s Door Thoughts and Impressions]] by Me for Max Frequency

>Hunting bosses down for their souls, reminds me of, well lots of games, but *Titan Souls* specifically comes to mind. I dabbled on Vita back when it came out.

Guess who made *Titan Souls*?

I had no idea that developer Acid Nerve made both *Death’s Door* and *Titan Souls*. I only found out today when I looked up the soundtrack for *Death’s Door* and the composer’s are the same person – David Fenn– aka 50% of Acid Nerve. David is their producer, designer, composer, and sound designer. Mark Foster is the programmer, writer, designer, and animator.

Out of all the kill-bosses-for-souls games, I chose to compare two from the same developer without even knowing.
