# Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble Live at Berklee Caf – insaneintherainmusic

[Sinnoh Fusion Ensemble Live at Berklee Caf (October 11 2019) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0gWhggLuck&t=87s)by insaneintherainmusic on YouTube

I know I am nearly two years late, but hot dog this is *wonderful*. I’ll forever be indebted to Logan Moore for introducing me to Carlos Eiene aka insaneintherainmusic last year when I was at his house for The Game Awards. These jazz arrangements quickly joined my regular rotation of music while working and traveling. 

Then while I’ve been reminiscing my days of play *Pokémon Diamond* on the Nintendo DS for my review of [[Delta 1.3 Thoughts & Impressions|Delta]], I also remembered Logan saying that insaneintherainmusic was spending 2020 recording an album of the *Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum* music. That would be *[Sinnohvation](https://insaneintherainmusic.bandcamp.com/album/sinnohvation)* and I have been listening for over a week straight now. 

I really loving seeing these musicians in action. It’s a treat and I think you’d enjoy it too.
