# Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury Looks Oh So Good

[A Bigger Badder Bowser – Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppkX8epoD9g)

*Super Mario 3D World* is another one of those wonderful Wii U games that not enough people played, for [obvious reasons](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/). It was a game I poured tons of hours into trying to complete it to 100% (stupid [Champion’s Road](https://youtu.be/VWsMA9qjDxs)). When it was announced as the next Wii U game to be ported to the Switch, I was already sold, additional content or not.

Then Nintendo pulled back the curtain on *Bowser’s Fury*.

Holy smokes! It’s a wacky *3D World*, *Sunshine*, *Odyssey* fusion. It seems like Bowser waking up from his black, inky slumber is even a bit reminiscent of the blood moon in *Breath of the Wild*. This expansion seems more meaty than I originally expected, but I can’t imagine it being too substantial. Maybe a few hours of gameplay instead of a handful of levels that I originally expected. It is interesting to see Nintendo taking the gameplay, assets, and design of *3D World* and actually making an open 3D environment to explore.

Once this releases next month, the only 3D Mario games missing on the Switch will be *Super Mario Galaxy 2* and *Super Mario 3D Land*. I am eager to dig back into one of my favorite Wii U games.
