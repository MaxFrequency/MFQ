# Metroid Dread Announced

[Metroid Dread Nearing Completion](https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/27/metroid-dread-nearing-completion) by Matt Casamassina for IGN on August 27, 2007

> In 2005, IGN got hold of an official internal Nintendo software list that revealed a number of key DS games set to be announced in the future. All of the games on the list, including titles like *Super Princess Peach*, were eventually announced and released. All, that is, except for one — a project known simply as *Metroid Dread*. To this day, *Metroid Dread*, thought to be a traditional 2D sequel in the *Metroid* franchise designed specifically for Nintendo’s dual-screen handheld, has never publicly been acknowledged by the mega-publisher. But an unofficial nod to the project has been found hidden within the 20-hour adventure of fantastic Wii first-person adventure *Metroid Prime 3: Corruption*, developed by Retro Studios.

> Players who journey deep enough into Samus Aran’s Wii quest can use Aran’s scan visor to read lore and lob enemies and objects. Doing just that on one mid-game world, we stumbled upon a panel with the following message, quoted verbatim below:

> “Experiment status report update: Metroid project ‘Dread’ is nearing the final stages of completion.”

16 years later, [Nintendo has finally revived the *Metroid Dread* name](https://youtu.be/8NjCICl7dDo), launching on Nintendo Switch October 8, 2021.

Ironically (and thankfully), I decided to record my reaction to the Direct for the first time ever. I [happily lost it](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1404846983500677128) when Nintendo acknowledged my favorite bounty hunter.

Arlo’s [reaction](https://youtu.be/sVH04K63NL8) is also very fun.
