# Ratchet & Clank - Rift Apart Review - The Best PS5 Game So Far – Logan Moore’s Review

[*Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* Review: The Best PS5 Game So Far](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-review/) by Logan Moore for Comicbook.com

> *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* is easily the best game that the PlayStation 5 now has to offer. From top to bottom, it offers an experience that is practically faultless and keeps you from ever wanting to put the controller down. Not only is Rift Apart itself superb, but as a showcase for what the PS5 is capable of, it’s likely the best example we have seen so far and continues to verify that Insomniac Games is one of the best studios in the world.

This is the only review I planned on reading for *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart*. Mostly because I have been avoiding spoilers for the past month and haven’t seen anything beyond the initial trailer. I just want to be surprised and delighted by the new game. Logan is one of my best friends though and I always read his reviews. It is just great to see him get a new PlayStation game so far in advance to be able to review. It makes it even more special that it sounds like the game is a grand slam. Color me even more jazzed for Friday!
