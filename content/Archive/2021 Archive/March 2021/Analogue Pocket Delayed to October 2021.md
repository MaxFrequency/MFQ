# Analogue Pocket Delayed to October 2021

Pocket is [delayed](https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375231296200704) once more.

> Pocket is delayed and shipping in October 2021.
> 
> The current global state of affairs continues to create supply chain challenges outside of our control.
> 
> There have been sudden and severe electrical component shortages as well as logistical issues leading to a domino effect of challenges for nearly everyone in the industry.
> 
> We’re working hard to get Pocket out as fast as possible and we appreciate your understanding and patience. An email is being sent to everyone who pre-ordered Pocket. If you have any questions about your pre-order or would like to cancel at anytime for a full refund, please contact Analogue Support at support.analogue.co or by email at support@analogue.co.

Unsurprising given the chip shortages around the world. It is such a shame this delay happened just one month before the previous target month of May 2021. I just [[MFP02 - “Against the Cruelness of Batteries and Time” with Cameron Hawkins|talked about its impending launch with Cameron Hawkins on my new podcast]], since we both snagged a [[Analogue Pocket Sells Out in 10 Minutes|pre-order]].

I can’t possibly see the Analogue Duo hitting 2021 now either. Analogue has [reassured](https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1377375464042323971) that the Super NT will be [[Analogue Console Restock Incoming|restocked]] next month, with the [[Analogue DAC Thoughts and Impressions|DAC]] and Mega SG following afterward.

I am really glad [[MiSTer FPGA Thoughts and Impressions – My Tool for Researching the Past|I went ahead and assembled a MiSTer now too]]. Now we wait for October…
