# September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month – 512 Pixels

[September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month](https://512pixels.net/2021/09/st-jude-sept-21/) by Stephen Hackett for 512 Pixels

> …Josiah is special. When he was just six months old, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
> 
> To be honest with you, his diagnosis feels like it was several lifetimes ago. It’s hard to keep track of how much he’s been through between surgeries and physical therapy and chemo and MRIs and feeding tubes and speech therapy and on and on and on. Cancer doesn’t give a rip about what you had planned; when dealing with a tumor, you’re on its turf most of the time.
> 
> Josiah made it through. He’s no longer a cancer patient; he’s a cancer survivor.
> 
> That’s thanks to the work being done at St. Jude.

Just like the title says, September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month. Each September, the podcast network Relay FM (co-founded by Stephen), raises money and awareness for St. Jude’s mission to save children from cancer. As of this writing, [they have already raised over $80,000](https://tiltify.com/@relay-fm/relay-st-jude-21) this year.

St. Jude does not charge the families a dime to treat their children. Donations allow families to focus on their children’s health, without the looming cloud of hospital bills.

From a network that has personally given me so much to an organization that has given countless hours of research and life-saving treatment, I hope you will consider [donating](https://tiltify.com/@relay-fm/relay-st-jude-21). My wife and I have been fortunate enough to donate for the past two years. Every single dollar helps these kids.

Don’t miss out on the Podcastathon on September 18 either:

> This month, you’ll hear about St. Jude across the Relay FM family of podcasts, and from 12-8 PM on September 17, Myke Hurley and I will be co-hosting the third annual Podcastathon for St. Jude [on Relay FM’s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/relayfm).
