[PlayStation: Bungie deal is about multiplatform, live-service games](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-31-playstation-bungie-will-considerably-accelerate-our-journey-with-multiplatform-live-service-games) by Christopher Dring for GamesIndustry.biz

> “The first thing to say unequivocally is that Bungie will stay an independent, multiplatform studio and publisher…”

So what is the $3.6 billion buying exactly? I’d say experience, technology, and user-base expansion. Sony is [clearly](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass) moving toward a more aggressive services offering. Bungie’s decades of experience for online communities and engagement is hard-earned. Owning Bungie gives Sony access to Bungie’s in-house tech and talent for creating some of the best first-person shooter games ever. Sort of reminds me of idTech being a highlight of the [[Microsoft Buys Bethesda for $7.5 Billion|ZeniMax acquisition]] just two years ago. There is a [loot cave](https://www.ign.com/wikis/destiny/Loot_Cave) of game design information within the halls of Bungie.

Also, Sony just bought the entire player base of *Destiny 2* and any future Bungie projects. That’s a consistent stream of revenue. I’m curious how [Bungie’s existing deal with Chinese company NetEase](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422410/bungie-netease-100-million-investment-china-destiny-business) will play into this acquisition. Whenever that game launches, those audiences will feed right into Sony — exclusive or not.

These purchases in the industry are far from over. Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard (I know I didn’t write about that one 😅) is just the largest flashing neon sign that says “CONSOLIDATION.” I am curious what other purchases Microsoft will make, if any. Cleaning out half of their cash for Activision Blizzard may slow major purchases for them. Maybe not. Sony definitely does not have the capital to make $68.7 billion moves, but they can apparently muster $3.6 billion here, a few billion dollars over there. Buckle up everyone.
