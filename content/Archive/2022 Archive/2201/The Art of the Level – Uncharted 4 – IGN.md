[*Uncharted 4*: Devs Reveal Secrets Behind the Series’ Best Chase Sequence – Art of the Level](https://youtu.be/ftJX0brjUEE) by Jonathon Dornbush for IGN

I’ve seen Jonathon Dornbush of IGN share his Art of the Level series since he started it, but never got around to watching it myself (even though there is [an episode on *The Last of Us Part II*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbJ8a1X5Paw&t=2s)). I have finally corrected my own mistake today with the new episode on the Madagascar chase in *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End*.

Shaun Escayg and Kurt Margenau shared the behind-the-scenes for one of the franchises most iconic set pieces and [legendary E3 demos](https://youtu.be/sB0xy74Zrj8).

Here’s what I wrote about the scene in [[Chasing the Stick - The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era|Chasing the Stick: The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era]]:

> The Madagascar chase works extremely well as both an *Uncharted* set piece and as a demo for press and fans. It ups the ante for the franchise, thanks to the power of the PS4 and all the experience under Naughty Dog’s belt. It has a wonderful sense of escalation. I actually think Dunkey put it best in his [Videogame Structure Evolution video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=68tCnWFxMTM&t=120). *Uncharted 4* has an undeniable cadence in its design.

I wonder if this set piece made it into the movie…
