Welcome to Chapter Select Season Three-ie!

Logan and I are thrilled to be exploring the *Banjo-Kazooie* series for the third season of Chapter Select. It’s been a long time coming, but it is still a shorter turn around than a proper *Banjo-Tooie* sequel.

As for this season’s slate of episodes, here is the order we have for Season 3:

- [[S3E1 - Banjo-Kazooie|Episode 1 – Banjo-Kazooie (Nintendo 64)]], releasing on May 18, 2022 with special guest [Michael Koczwara](https://twitter.com/SuperZambezi).
- [[S3E2 - Banjo-Kazooie - Nuts & Bolts|Episode 2 – Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (Xbox 360)]], releasing on June 1, 2022 with special guest [Michael Ruiz](https://twitter.com/TheMichaelJRuiz).
- [[S3E3 - Banjo-Tooie|Episode 3 – Banjo-Tooie (Nintendo 64)]], releasing on June 15, 2022 with special guest [Brian Henken](https://twitter.com/BrianHenken).
- [[S3E4 - Banjo-Kazooie - Grunty's Revenge|Episode 4 – Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty’s Revenge (Game Boy Advance)]], releasing on June 29, 2022.
- [[S3E5 - Conker's Bad Fur Day|Episode 5 – Conker’s Bad Fur Day (Nintendo 64)]], releasing on July 13, 2022.

This season has the highest ratio of guests to episodes so far in the show’s history. While tied with [[S1 - Paper Mario|Season 1 – Paper Mario]] with three guests, there’s more variety to go around this season. We are stoked for the voices you’ll hear alongside Logan’s and my own as we explore *Banjo-Kazooie*.

The art this season was a challenge for me. I’ll save the deep dive for the “look back” post when Season 3 wraps up, but I was heavily inspired by my own [[Announcing Wiki Stories — A Limited Run Newsletter|Wiki Stories]] and the recent emoji kick I have been on. It’s like I just discovered the variety emoji have. 👀 Finding the font designed by [Oakland Elliff](https://twitter.com/oakieland) gave the art the final push it needed.

The [teaser](https://youtu.be/Us_atGcbKAo) we released is one of my favorite ideas come to life. It would not have been possible without the technical prowess and knowhow of Michael Koczwara. I am eternally in his debt for bringing my whacky idea to life.

I hope you are as excited for [[S3 - Banjo-Kazooie|Season 3: Banjo-Kazooie]] as I am. The first episode will be launching next Wednesday, with new episodes following in a fortnightly manner. Subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts!
