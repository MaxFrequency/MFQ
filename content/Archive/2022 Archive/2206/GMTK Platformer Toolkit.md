[I Made a Video Essay That You Can PLAY](https://youtu.be/zWi0jgghGcI) by Mark Brown for Game Maker’s Toolkit

Mark Brown has just released a free game that allows players to fiddle with platformer mechanics and controls to learn about game design. This looks delightful. A great expansion of the GMTK pool of resources.

It’s playable in your browser or can be downloaded to you PC or Mac. If you are curious, you can check out the toolkit [here](https://gmtk.itch.io/platformer-toolkit).
