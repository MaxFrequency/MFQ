Between this and [Hideo Kojima’s Spotify-exclusive podcast](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/23/23318748/hideo-kojima-podcast-brain-structure-spotify-september-eight), I’ll take Sakurai’s insight and videos any day—open, accessible, and educational.

I am excited, like most, to see the *Smash Bros.* design insight. The real gem will be Sakurai talking about any other game and his thoughts on how design works.
