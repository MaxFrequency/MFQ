[Welcoming Savage Game Studios + Expanding Our Community](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/29/welcoming-savage-game-studios-expanding-our-community/?sf259926637=1) by Hermen Hulst for the PlayStation.Blog

> As we assured you before with our plans to bring select titles to PC, our efforts beyond console in no way diminish our commitment to the PlayStation community, nor our passion to keep making amazing single-player, narrative-driven experiences…
> 
> Our mobile gaming efforts will be similarly additive, providing more ways for more people to engage with our content, and striving to reach new audiences unfamiliar with PlayStation and our games. Savage Game Studios is joining a newly created PlayStation Studios Mobile Division, which will operate independently from our console development and focus on innovative, on-the-go experiences based on new and existing PlayStation IP.

The PlayStation Studios shopping spree is not over yet. Savage Game Studios is the latest purchase with a focus on mobile games. Like Nixxes for PC ports, PlayStation now has a mobile-first development team. PlayStation (and parent company Sony) are investing in teams tailored for specific markets; freeing up their core development teams to keep cranking out those “amazing single-player, narrative-driven experiences.” Colin Moriarty and I spoke about this on The Max Frequency Podcast [[MFP16 - “A Growing Individualistic Power” with Colin Moriarty|earlier this month]].

> They’re already working on a new unannounced AAA mobile live service action game. It’s too early to reveal more, but I’m so excited for when they’ll be able to.

[Last year](https://venturebeat.com/games/savage-game-studios-raises-4-4-million-for-mobile-shooter-game/), Savage Game Studios secured $4.4 million to build up their two studios and were making a shooter for mobile. I wonder if that is the same game as mentioned above. [PlayStation’s partnership with Backbone](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/07/28/introducing-backbone-one-playstation-edition-an-officially-licensed-controller-for-playstation/) suddenly makes a lot more sense. Between this and a newfound emphasis on streaming games with their tiered PlayStation Plus subscription, PlayStation is looking toward mobile and live services far more aggressively this generation. Throw in all the TV shows and movies that PlayStation have in the works and you’ll start to see the posse of Sony Ponies expanding out on the entertainment frontier.
