[Child Predators Use Amazon’s Twitch to Systematically Track Kids Who Stream ](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitch-problem-with-child-predators/?leadSource=uverify%20wall)by Cecilia D’Anastasio for Bloomberg

> The reporting shows how alleged predators are able to target multiple children simultaneously using common grooming tactics. In late July, one Twitch voyeur entered the livestream of four different young users and asked them to perform acts including “spicy dares,” slang for requests that may be indecent or vulgar. One stream attracted 290 viewers. In that case, Twitch shut down the broadcast after 30 minutes. But others go unmoderated.

I remember back in 2008 when [[Stickam-Profile-Mudkip143.png|I would stream live]] on [Stickam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickam) choppy 240p screen capture of emulators. I’ll never forget sitting in the dining room, streaming *Mega Man Battle Network 3*, when someone entered the chat. Very exciting to a 14-year-old trying to connect out on the Internet.

It didn’t take long for this individual to begin using explicit language to describe my body and what they wanted to do with me. They couldn’t even see me – just hear my voice. I felt fear and shame. I reported the account, told my parents, and never streamed on Stickam again.
