Bethesda *[tweeted](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1592971214817222656)* out this statement in regard to [[Mick Gordon’s Statement about DOOM Eternal’s Soundtrack|Mick Gordon’s thorough account of the DOOM Eternal score and soundtrack debacle]].

> The recent post by Mick Gordon both mischaracterized and misrepresented the team at id Software, the development of DOOM Eternal, Marty Stratton, and Chad Mossholder with a one-sided and unjust account of an irreparable professional relationship.
> 
> We are aware of all the details and history in this matter and unequivocally support Marty, Chad, and the team at id Software. We reject the distortion of the truth and selective presentation of incomplete “facts.” We stand ready with full and complete documented evidence to disclose in an appropriate venue as needed.
> 
> The statements posted online have incited harassment and threats of violence against Marty, Chad, and the id Software team. Any threats or harassment directed towards members of our teams will be met with swift and appropriate action to protect their health and safety.
> 
> We remain incredibly proud of id’s previous collaborations with Mick Gordon and ask that fans refrain from reaching conclusions based on his account and, more importantly, from attacking any of the individuals mentioned on either side, including Marty, Chad, or Mick.

Says a lot to even respond publicly to Mick and his account with four paragraphs in a little image. It comes off as written by Marty himself. He seems to have no issue using public company accounts to tell a story. We’ll see how this shakes out.
