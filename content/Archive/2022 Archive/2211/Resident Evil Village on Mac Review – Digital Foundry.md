[Resident Evil Village on Mac Review: MetalFX Upscaling Challenges DLSS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iXx9lfe62w&t=870s) by Oliver Mackenzie for Digital Foundry on YouTube

The accomplishment of MetalFX upscaling on the M1 lineup here is impressive. I wonder what Apple will be able to offer developers when the inevitable Apple Silicon Mac Pro hits shelves. Capcom proves that the Mac can be a place to game now. I hope other developers take notice and time to port their games to Apple Silicon.
