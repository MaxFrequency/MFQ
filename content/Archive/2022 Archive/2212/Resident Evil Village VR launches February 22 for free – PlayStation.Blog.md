[*Resident Evil Village* VR Mode launches February 22 for PS VR2 as free DLC](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/14/resident-evil-village-vr-mode-launches-february-22-for-ps-vr2-as-free-dlc/) by Kanda Tsuyoshi for the PlayStation Blog

> Today, I’m happy to reveal that this additional mode will release on February 22, 2023 as a free DLC for *Resident Evil Village*. You can download and play it immediately when you get your PlayStation VR2.

Always suspected this was going to launch with PS VR2 and be free, considering *Resident Evil 7*‘s launch on PS4 and PS VR, but nice to see it in writing. I will say this, it sure doesn’t feel like PS VR2 launches in just *69 days*.
