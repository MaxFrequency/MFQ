# Knotwords “Book talk” and reveal – Zach Gage & Jack Schesinger

[Zach Gage](https://twitter.com/helvetica) and [Jack Schlesinger](https://twitter.com/games_by_jack)’s new game is out this Thursday—[Knotwords](http://www.playknotwords.com/). To reveal the game, the pair did a live stream exploring prototypes and explaining their new word game. An insightful stream for undoubtedly another grand slam for the duo.

A real interesting bit is that there are three tiers/versions: a free version with no ads, a subscription version with more puzzles, or a one-time payment of $12 with the same range of puzzles. On PC, solely the paid version is available. The barrier to entry is so low *without* the incessant nature of ads.

I love it when developers are open about their creative process and iteration. You know I will be downloading it immediately.
