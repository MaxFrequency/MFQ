# LG C2 OLED Reviewed for Modern & Retro Gaming – My Life in Gaming

[LG C2 OLED Reviewed for Modern & Retro Gaming – 2022 C2 vs. 2021 C1 vs. 2017 C7](https://youtu.be/7K2tSrnxqVk) by My Life in Gaming on YouTube

I haven’t written about it here yet, but I recently did buy an LG C1 thanks to a 5-year-warranty and a few dead pixels on my LG C9 OLED. It turns out that I bought the LG C1 *right* before the LG C2 went on sale. I chalked it up to off timing, but have mostly been happy with the C1. It does have a couple of quirks that my C9 did not have, like slower timing to show the image when watching TV/movies and the insistent need to dim the picture even further when in a dark scene for more than 30 seconds (yes, all the auto / AI dimming is off. This is something baked into the OS and only alterable from a service menu it seems).

Turns out I may have dodged a bullet though with the C2. Try over at My Life in Gaming went through the wringer with the C2, which has whacky input-lag issues and other issues. He produced a deep dive into comparing his five-year-old C7, the C2, and the C1. OLED TVs promise a great future for newer games and consoles, but they handle some older aspect ratios poorly. I wish TV manufacturers would let their televisions just be a TV, instead of cramming it with what they think people want and bloated “AI.”
