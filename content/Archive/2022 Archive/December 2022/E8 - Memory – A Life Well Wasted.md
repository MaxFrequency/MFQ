# E8 - Memory – A Life Well Wasted

[E8: Memory](http://alifewellwasted.com/) by Robert Ashley for A Life Well Wasted

> Robert Ashley finds out what it takes to speedrun games in a blindfold, visits a museum in Moscow dedicated to Soviet-era arcade machines, and talks to a group of friends about a childhood summer spent dreaming up a game of their own.

This *immediately* jumped to the top of my podcast queue. I haven’t listened to *A Life Well Wasted* since I worked at K-Mart. Thrilled to have a new episode in my feed. Robert knows how to make a captivating show. The magic of podcasting strikes again.
