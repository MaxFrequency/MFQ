My friend Logan Moore told me yesterday that the *Gran Turismo* series is “all about vibes.” After pouring a cup of coffee this morning and watching the half-hour State of Play, I understand what he meant. Cafes, museums, science lessons on how clouds are formed are not tidbits I would have expected in a car video game showcase. Nevertheless, they were effortlessly embedded in the discussion in a soothing manner. 

I’ve gone from “*Gran Turismo* isn’t for me” to “Yes, please.”
