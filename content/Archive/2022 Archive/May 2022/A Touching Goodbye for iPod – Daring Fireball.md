# A Touching Goodbye for iPod â€“ Daring Fireball

[Daring Fireball: A Touching Goodbye for iPod](https://daringfireball.net/2022/05/touching_goodbye_for_ipod) by John Gruber for Daring Fireball

> Apple, today, announcing that the last remaining iPod modelâ€‰â€”â€‰the iPod Touchâ€‰â€”â€‰is now discontinued and available only while supplies lastâ€¦

The iPod was the first Apple product I owned. I suspect many folks share that experience. I remember using my friendâ€™s first-generation iPod Nano to showcase why I should be allowed to get an iPod. I totally misunderstood what turning the playhead into a diamond meant. I figured it was a style choice rather than the UI design for scrubbing. ðŸ˜¬

Later I would get a blue second-generation iPod Nano that I rocked through high school, until I was given an iPod Classic for Christmas. I remember watching *Avatar: The Last Airbender* at driverâ€™s ed and listening to a leaked rip of Daft Punkâ€™s *Random Access Memories* in the stock room of Kmart. Lately, Iâ€™ve missed having a device solely dedicated to music/media.

One more bit from John, before his own memories:

> I suspect most people reading this news will experience two thoughts, simultaneously:
> 
> Thatâ€™s a shame, I loved the iPod.
> 
> Wait, they were still selling the iPod Touch?

Johnâ€™s suspicion was spot on when I told my dad that the iPod line was discontinued. He had no idea one was even for sale.
