# Mick Gordon’s Statement about DOOM Eternal’s Soundtrack

[My full statement regarding *DOOM Eternal*](https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce) by Mick Gordon

> Marty lied about the circumstances surrounding the *DOOM Eternal* Soundtrack and used disinformation and innuendo to blame me entirely for its failure.
> 
> Afterwards, he offered me a six-figure settlement to never speak about it.
> 
> As far as I’m concerned, the truth is more important.
> 
> Marty’s Reddit post severely impacted both my professional and personal reputation. In releasing this statement, I’m exercising my right to defend myself. It is a defence, not an unprovoked attack, issued with extreme reluctance only after all other attempts to resolve the matter have failed.
> 
> This statement is not an excuse for a hate campaign. Acts of hate dished out online won’t result in any positive change. In fact, it only makes things worse.

Mick’s enthralling account of *DOOM Eternal*‘s soundtrack is gut-wrenching. id Software and Marty Stratton’s behavior is inexcusable and disgusting. If I were Phil Spencer, I’d have Marty out ASAP.
