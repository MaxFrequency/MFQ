# Dunkey Launches Indie Game Publishing Company Bigmode

[My Indie Game Publishing Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEt27Jgp8gs) by videogamedunkey

Dunkey is branching out of YouTube and into video game publishing. His video is very hype—very Dunkey. He invokes indie titans like *Celeste*, *Enter the Gungeon*, and *Hollow Knight*. There are plenty of games I’ve never heard of or seen.

I am a smidge surprised at the criticism of this venture in the just 12 or so hours since its announcement. I generally lean on a half-full perspective, but I’ve seen the devs, publishers, and press share a range of feedback. Takes from “I have opinions on games, so now I can publish the best” to “get lots of money upfront incase it fails.” All of these come off as valid criticisms to me, if leaning to the pessimist/realist perspective. That’s probably a safer approach in business.

Here’s what Dunkey’s company Bigmode is looking for:

> Here’s what excites us in a game!
> Fun
> Substance
> Originality
> Passion & artistry
> Devs with a clear, strong vision
> Devs with deep gaming experience & understanding

Aren’t we all?

And here is what Bigmode is offering devs:

> We believe quality & originality should be supported— Bigmode is a unique & powerful way for great indie games to stand out in a crowded space, and our publishing contracts are designed to be the most developer-friendly possible!
> We can get involved at any stage from pitch to near-completion. We can also assist with any standard publishing needs you may have:
> Funding
> Development support
> PR & community management
> QA, porting & localization
> Merchandising

To me, Bigmode comes off as dunkey’s [Official Seal of Quality](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Seal). His videos do have sway and power. I would think his financial backing would alleviate sides of development and publishing so that the devs can focus on making the game. It’s not just exposure. I am curious how it will all play out. I hope for the best for all involved.

No matter success or failure, the mascot is *divine*.
