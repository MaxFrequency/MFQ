# September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month â€“ 2022 Notice

It is [[St. Jude and Relay FM|once]] [[September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month â€“ 512 Pixels|again]] September and you know what that means. With it being Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, the fine folks at Relay FM are once again raising money for St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital.

Itâ€™s not even noon and they are nearing $45K (so theyâ€™ve been raising money for a week or so ðŸ¤«). You can help raise even more money by [donating](https://relay.experience.stjude.org/).

This year, you can even sign up to [fundraise alongside Relay FM](https://tiltify.com/st-jude-children-s-research-hospital/relay-fm-for-st-jude-2022/start/) with all funds going to the same place and same overall goals. There are sweet looking incentives and donation rewards all around. But the greatest reward is helping put an end of childhood cancer.

As always, mark the Podcastathon in your calendar! This year it is on September 16, 2022 at 12:00 PM EST to 8:00 PM EST. [Myke Hurley](http://twitter.com/imyke) and [Stephen Hackett](http://twitter.com/ismh) will be together in person for this eight hour variety show.

With [[The Next Generation|my own baby on the way]], hearing Stephen share [his familyâ€™s story](https://maxfrequency.net/2021/09/01/st-jude-relay-fm-2021-fundraising/) once again about Josiah and discovering a brain tumor at six months of age, my heart swells in a way it never has before. Please considering [donating](https://relay.experience.stjude.org/).
