[LINE BY LINE (Majoraâ€™s Mask True Story)](https://youtu.be/ISKWr8rI2sI) by Javed Sterritt for The Hyrule Journals on YouTube

Nearly four years after his first Zelda essay[^1], Javed Sterritt has published his video about *The Legend of Zelda: Majoraâ€™s Mask*. I remember being stirred by Javedâ€™s [*Ocarina of Time* video](https://youtu.be/GyUcwsjyd8Q) back in 2019. [[The Legend of Zelda - Ocarina of Time's Story is Elevated by This Video Essay|I wrote about it]] back at DualShockers just a few days after the video was published.

Thereâ€™s no better way to kick off the new year than by watching this documentary.

Now, me being me, not only am I watching for the story, but Iâ€™m studying the editing, pacing, and style. Javed seems to use some widescreen, HD texture pack modified version of the two N64 classics.[^2] I am often a purist when it comes to representing game footage, but the use of these enhanced versions enhances the presentation of the video.[^3] The story is enriched as you are immersed in the footage.

I love the desk Javed uses in some shots. The lighting and texture is warm. I particularly loved [his shot of the Game Boy Color](https://youtu.be/ISKWr8rI2sI&t=253). Slick cut on the placement of the console as well.

Now, continuing the theme of me being me, I immediately noticed the Macintosh Powerbook G3 used at the [10:09 mark](https://youtu.be/ISKWr8rI2sI&t=608). I also noticed the version of Excel on its display was the Microsoft Office 98 for Windows, not the Macintosh Edition. ðŸ˜…

The theme of isolation that is prominent throughout *Majoraâ€™s Mask* (so Iâ€™m told) is represented in the gameâ€™s development. Not just from the top creative brass or the programmers, but even down to the translation and localization. I know what it feels like to stare at tens of thousands of lines in Excel and wondering if youâ€™ll ever reach the end. I do not know what working on one of the most important sequels ever feels like. Jason Leungâ€™s story is spot on and told in a thoughtful and wonderful way.

> [!note] Update (1/5/23): 
> Javed has taken down the original upload of Line By Line [[IMG_8375.jpg|citing]] translation issues. Iâ€™ve got the quote below and will update the link when a new one is provided. Props on taking the video down, swallowing the hit to view count and the algorithm all for the sack of accuracy. Maybe heâ€™ll change the Excel footage too?

> Iâ€™ve had some wonderful people from the Zelda and localising community point out some incorrect translations in the doco. After some consideration, Iâ€™ve decided to go and fix these issues and reupload. Will post the new link soon. Thank you everyone and sorry for the inconvenience.

> [!note] Update (1/11/23): 
> Javed has uploaded the new version of Line By Line. The links above have been updated. I think he swapped the PowerBookâ€¦

[^1]: Perhaps I should call it a journal entry instead.
[^2]: The *Ocarina of Time* version could be the PC port, while *Majoraâ€™s Mask* version might be modified with texture packs. Writing up this tiny paragraph sent me down the mod path for these games. Now I have the reverse-engineered PC port of *OoT* on my iMac. The community has done some buck wild stuff.
[^3]: Can I even be called a purist when I capture and stream old games off FPGA systems or pass old consoles through an upscaler? Wouldnâ€™t purity require showing off these games through an RF cable? Javedâ€™s own use of CRT filters and effects could be argued as more "pure" than my own typical representation. But I digress from this philosophical tangent.
