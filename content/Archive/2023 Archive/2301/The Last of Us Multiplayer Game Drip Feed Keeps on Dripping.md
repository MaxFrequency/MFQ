[Reflecting on a Big Year to Come for *The Last of Us*](https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_10th_anniversary_kickoff) by Neil Druckmann for Naughty Dog

> We’re looking ahead to *The Last of Us*’ 10th anniversary in June, and we’re so excited to share more with you about the future of this franchise. We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious *The Last of Us* multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay. We first shared concept art of the project with you last year, and we hope this new piece of concept art below further excites you for what our team is working on.

The [[TLOU Online teaser-image.jpg|cruise ship]] reminds me of one of Naughty Dog’s biggest and best set pieces: the cruise ship in *Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception*. That is another fine level that showcases [[Uncharted 3’s Chateau and the Art of Escalation|the art of escalation]] in glorious fashion.

These two pieces of concept art give a vibe, sure, but we are getting to the point where I’d like to see and know more. This a problem Naughty Dog is combating. They no longer want to announce games years in advance. Like [[Naughty Dog’s Next Game has a Writer’s Room|I mentioned last week]] and [[Exploring Development Time for Naughty Dog’s PlayStation Catalog|back in June 2020]], the turnaround from announcement to release got way out of hand with the studio.

The cloud looming over this multiplayer game was that it was an assumed component of *The Last of Us Part II*. Then Naughty Dog confirmed its existence and its removal from the game—][[Chasing the Stick - The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era|at the same time]]. The team is not ready to show it off, but they need to keep the drip going to maintain awareness and excitement. I just hope the next time they talk about the game, we get footage and a proper name.
