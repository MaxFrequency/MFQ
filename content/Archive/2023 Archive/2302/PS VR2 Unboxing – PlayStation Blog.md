[PlayStation VR2 Unboxing](https://youtu.be/ZglnMO8kyQ8) by PlayStation

PS VR2 is out in the press’ hands and it finally feels like Sony is ramping up the previews and promotion. We are only 12 days away from the first deliveries being made. I’d wager on reviews being live late next week or the beginning of launch week. It’s positive to see units out and about two weeks early.

One tidbit from the official unboxing that I wasn’t aware of before. I was surprised to see the earbud integration with the headset. They nestle into the headband area and then the buds chill out in the cutouts along the outside. So slick and clean. This keeps wires from dangling down. I really hope that I can use the Pulse headset in the same manner.
