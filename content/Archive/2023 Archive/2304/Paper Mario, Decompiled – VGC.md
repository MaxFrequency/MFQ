[*Paper Mario* has been fully decompiled, meaning PC ports and mods are possible](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/paper-mario-has-been-fully-decompiled-meaning-pc-ports-and-mods-are-possible/) by Chris Scullion for Video Games Chronicle

> Coder Ethan Roseman says he’s been able to reverse engineer the game’s full source code, resulting in a recreation of the code rather than a straight copy.

I’ve have had the itch to spend time with *Paper Mario* as of late. Perhaps it’s because I see it in retro stores for $90 and have begun to think “that’s not *that* [expensive](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/paper-mario).” Perhaps, I just want that cozy game while my life is surrounded by change and hustle.

Glad to see N64 classics continue to be broken down for the PC world.
