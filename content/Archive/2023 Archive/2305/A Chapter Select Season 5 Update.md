Hello everybody! I have a quick update for [[Chapter Select]] and the [[S5 - Resident Evil|Season 5]] finale.Â 

I have to delay the episode. My wife and I just bought a house and this move has been more demanding than I anticipated. The episode has been recorded, but I do not have the 4-5 hours to edit, produce, and publish the finale before Wednesday, May 31.[^1]

My office is just a big olâ€™ pile in the garage. My iMac is in its box. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll get to setting up my desk. It should be soonish on the list, since I do primarily work from home. Once my computer is plugged in, I know I can wake up early a couple of days and knock the edit out.Â 

I am disappointed I couldnâ€™t get this done in time. I hate delaying a publicly promised project. Consistency is the key to growth and trust. I ran out of time. I am sorry I dropped the ball right at the finish line.Â 

Thankfully, Logan and I have now both moved within the last year, so major geographical events should be behind us. Plus, Season 6 is already half way done. ðŸ˜‰Â 

Thank you all for your understanding and patience. I promise I will get to editing as soon as I can. Also, how hype was that *Resident Evil 4* VR Mode [teaser](https://youtu.be/E_s9Ch6c4z0). Bring on the VR games!
