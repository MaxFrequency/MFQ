[Trying Paper Mario: TTYD Hero Mode! | August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/6OB6zd4ccRA)

The YouTube algorithm informed me of the existence of a difficult *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* mod dubbed “Hero Mode.” It’s playable on real hardware and with [[Building My Dream GameCube|my fancy new modded Spice Orange GameCube]][^1], I figured there would be no better time to try the demo.

The demo apparently goes up to the start of Chapter 2 in the game and if it is as tough as I fear, then it should be a lot of fun. I haven’t seen too much of it, so it will all be a surprise to me! I hope you’ll hang out with me tomorrow night (8/23/23) at 7:00 PM EST.
