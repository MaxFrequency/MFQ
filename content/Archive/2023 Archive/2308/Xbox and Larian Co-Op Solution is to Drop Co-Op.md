[Baldur’s Gate 3 will be coming to Xbox this year, with split-screen removed for Series S](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-will-be-coming-to-xbox-this-year-with-split-screen-removed-for-series-s/) by Chris Scullion for VGC

> “Super happy to confirm that after meeting Phil Spencer yesterday, we’ve found a solution that allows us to bring *Baldur’s Gate 3* to Xbox players this year still, something we’ve been working towards for quite some time. All improvements will be there, with split-screen co-op on Series X. Series S will not feature split-screen co-op, but will also include cross-save progression between Steam and Xbox Series.”

Said solution mentioned [[Phil Spencer, Founder of the Modern Day Mid-Gen Refresh, Thinks Mid-Gen Refreshes Cause “A Bunch of Issues”|yesterday]] was to remove functionality. I’m sure the Venn diagram of Xbox Series S owners who want to play *Baldur’s Gate 3* with local split-screen doesn’t exist. I wonder if this is a green light for devs to just drop gameplay to support Series S better or if this is a case by case situation.
