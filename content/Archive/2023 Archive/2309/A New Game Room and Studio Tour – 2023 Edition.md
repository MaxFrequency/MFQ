About four months ago, my family and I moved into our first home. With all this new space, I have my own room again. I‚Äôve made [a new game room/studio tour video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=q-aTcFuVygI) to share with you all. I hope you enjoy.

The video also acts as a time capsule for myself. In building out this space, I‚Äôve been watching tons of tours to get ideas and inspiration. I even went back to 15-year-old YouTube videos to see some of my original setups. My mind would have been blown to know the entertainment center I have today.

I struggled figuring out this project though. It bounced back and forth between a written post and a video. I tried the vlogger video style, but found the design not inline with my current tastes. Creativity flows. I felt far more energized to style my own tour video after [My Life in Gaming](https://youtube.com/watch?v=zDQ46F_QO8I) and [Game Sack](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kCnrHDfldFM).[^1]

I decided to put my DSLR camera and fancy lens to work too. It made for a nice crash course back into the world of big cameras. I think the autofocus was a bit jittery and the harsh (i.e. stupid bright) overhead LEDs gave the auto settings a bit of a challenge. I was tempted to just use my iPhone a few times, but I found enjoyment in using my ‚Äúreal‚Äù gear.

It was fun to come up with the shots. I wrote a script and wrote out shot ideas. My favorite (and most nerve-racking) was the spinning shot near the beginning . I mounted the camera on the tripod and placed it on my spinning chair.2 I jerry-rigged my own slider by using a coffee table and some boxes to even out my camera. This was a good creative challenge.

I feel good finally producing this video. It feels like a creative barrier has been lifted. I filmed a pickups video awhile ago, but just didn‚Äôt feel good about it without this coming out first. Maybe I‚Äôll re-shoot that entire project now. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è For now, back to my [[Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM|month-long Mario Kart marathon for the kids at St. Jude]] and making more podcasts!

[^2]: This was a direct homage to Coury‚Äôs [spinning shot](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hVW-ljlXHqI&t=690) in My Life in Gaming‚Äôs RGB102. I still wonder how he got himself in the frame. Maybe just did three takes with the camera on the same track. That way he can slice in post?
