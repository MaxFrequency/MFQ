[[3000years.jpg|Finally]].

Seems like I picked a real good time to try out the [[Streaming Paper Mario - The Thousand-Year Door – Hero Mode|Hero Mode]] mod on [[Thursday Night Stream – Finishing Paper Mario - TTYD – Hero Mode|stream]]. And of course, my podcast [[Chapter Select]] has [[S1 - Paper Mario|everything Thousand-Year Door covered]]. Perhaps we will return to this remaster (remake?). God, I am so happy to see this world back.
