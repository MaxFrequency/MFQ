[The Order: 1886 – Spooky Season Stream | October 6, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/z2Mz24zlbWw)

Well folks, I did it. I raced every cup, track, game in the *Mario Kart* franchise. We raised $620 over the course of the month! This totally blew my mind and I am so thankful for everyone that tuned in or donated. I plan on writing a reflective post about what I learned and some behind-the-scenes[^1], but now it is time for my Thursday* night streams to return to “regularly” scheduled programming.

For October, I wanted to pick some spooky-themed games. To kick off the month, I decided to return to *The Order: 1886*. It’s a short and sweet game that seemed perfect for streaming. I won’t beat it in one sitting like I did eight years ago, but I imagine I’ll still have fun.

I’ve [[Millennial Gaming Speak – Episode 3 - GDC Wrap-Up|long been a defender]] of *The Order: 1886*. The game seems to be having a [reflective](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QJm0wreAOK0) resurgence this year with people [realizing](https://x.com/MitchyD/status/1708149575658414304)/remembering it wasn’t all that bad. Maybe in today’s landscape of 60-100 hour open world RPGs, a highly polished AAA 5-6 hour cover shooter is refreshing. Come hang out tonight and let’s find out if I was right eight years ago.
