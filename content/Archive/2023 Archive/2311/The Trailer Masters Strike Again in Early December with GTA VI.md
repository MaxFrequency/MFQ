Well I'll be...

Friendly reminder that Rockstar makes *immaculate* trailers. I consider [these](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gmA6MrX81z4) *Red Dead Redemption II* [trailers](https://youtube.com/watch?v=F63h3v9QV7w) to be [all-timers](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eaW0tYpxyp0), alongside the [[Change, Hype, and Zelda|2017 Breath of the Wild trailer]] and the "[Everyone is Here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=EXnbMp1yr1k)" *Smash* trailer.

Another friendly reminder would be to not believe any release window in said upcoming trailer.
