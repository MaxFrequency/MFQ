I've been kicking the can of an idea to adapt my [[Uncharted 3’s Chateau and the Art of Escalation|Art of Escalation piece]] into a video essay. Seemed like a solid template to build off into a video. So when trying to pick a game to stream tonight, I figured why not *Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception*. 

I have a list of some set pieces I think I ought to get raw footage of, most of all the Château itself. I thought it'd be fun to bounce around some of the best set pieces *Uncharted* has to offer. 

Come swing by the [stream](http://maxfrequency.live) tonight at 8:00 PM EST to hang out while I play and capture some of the greatest hits from *Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception*.
