Hello everybody! Back in July, Logan and I [[Announcing Super Chapter Select|announced Super Chapter Select]]. It's a member-supported tier of the show with longer shows, exclusive episodes, and bonus videos. As we wind down [[S6 - Pokémon|Season 6 – Pokémon]] here, we decided to release a special from each season during these interstitial weeks.

This week, we've got this look at two versions of *Resident Evil 2* that never took off. Logan plays the original PS1 build starring Leon and extremely cool biker lady Elza Walker. Then I show off the GBA pitch for the game from Raylight Studios. 

As I dug deeper into the *Resident Evil* franchise during [[S5 - Resident Evil|Season 5]], I gravitated toward all the various demos and failed versions. I felt these would be dope was to explore the series for our members. I wish some of those *RE4* demos with hookman and the like would leak some day.

If you'd like to see everything we have to offer, you can sign up for Super Chapter Select right now! It is only [$2.50 per month](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=99142) or [$20 a year](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=76115)! You'll get access to nearly 30 hours of member-exclusive material across almost all our seasons.
