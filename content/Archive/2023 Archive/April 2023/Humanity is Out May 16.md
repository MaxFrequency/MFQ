# Humanity is Out May 16

The fine folks over at Enhance and tha have announced the release date for the puzzle game Humanity with a total [throwback mishmash](https://youtu.be/iM1yO7bcqqk) of trailers.

Full disclosure; I was a play tester for *Humanity* and was financially compensated for my time. I [[MFP26 - ‚ÄúMind-Boggling Effects‚Äù with Chris Johnston|chatted]] with Chris Johnston about it on [[The Max Frequency Podcast]]. I‚Äôd love to do a full, non-NDA-breaking write up about my experience someday after launch. I am stoked to dive in again and chase the Platinum.

Eagle-eyed viewers may be able to find a level I made in the trailer. üëÄ

Procrastination pays off again! Mark MacDonald and my friend Chris Johnston published a [deep dive](https://youtu.be/QyAsm6_iT9I) into the gameplay and modes of *Humanity* on the PlayStation YouTube channel. If you want a taste of what I was able to experience, check it out.
