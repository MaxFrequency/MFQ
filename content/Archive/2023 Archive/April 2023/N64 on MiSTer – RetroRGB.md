# N64 on MiSTer – RetroRGB

[MiSTer FPGA News – Nintendo 64, Neo Geo Pocket, Simpsons & More](https://www.retrorgb.com/mister-fpga-news-nintendo-64-neo-geo-pocket-simpsons-more.html) by Lu for RetroRGB

I’ve been [[Bye Bye Birdie – Leaving Twitter|off Twitter]] all year (which has felt great), but I’ve realized lately that Twitter was my main source for retro gaming news. So I hopped over to RetroRGB and plopped their RSS feed in NetNewsWire. Lo and behold, a few days later, I am made aware that Robert (aka FPGAzumSpass of PSX core fame) is working on a [N64 core](https://twitter.com/AzumFpg/status/1648610131544793089). If anyone can crank out that wizardry, he can.

Happy to be plugged back in a bit and to see FPGA emulation tackling the beast that is the Nintendo 64.
