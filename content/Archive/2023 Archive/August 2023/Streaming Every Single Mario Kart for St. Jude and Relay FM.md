# Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM

Every September is childhood cancer awareness month. And since 2019, podcast network Relay FM has raised $2.2 million with their community. For the [[St. Jude and Relay FM|past]] [[September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month â€“ 512 Pixels|three]] [[September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month â€“ 2022 Notice|years]] , Iâ€™ve shared and donated, but for 2023 I wanted to do more.

Iâ€™ll be streaming myself racing in every track in every single *Mario Kart* game.[^1][^2] Every Thursday evening during September from 7:00 PM EST to whenever I beat that nightâ€™s slate of games, Iâ€™ll be burning rubber and raising money.

You can [donate](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude) right now!

Here is the schedule:

### September 7, 2023 â€” [Race Day #1 Stream Link](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbUKrYBUUYs)

So whatâ€™s up with the asterisk? Well, *MK8D*â€™s 96 tracks includes all the Booster Course DLC pack, which has one more wave of tracks to drop before the end of 2023. Iâ€™m not sure that will release by the end of September, but you never know!

BUT! There is a way you can add more tracks to this month-long race. Thanks to the campaign tools, I can set incentives and such. One tier is to add the [All Cup Tour](https://mariokart.fandom.com/wiki/All_Cup_Tour) to my *Double Dash* session, making me play *Double Dash* twice. Another is to add the fan modded *Mario Kart 64: Amped Up*, which houses 16 tracks of its own!

Those arenâ€™t the only incentives either. Want to pick which speed I play at? Am I racing in Mirror Mode? Those are the ones I feel like I can safely figure out how to offer. Maybe throughout the month Iâ€™ll find ways to let folks pay to pick my racer or kart or controller? I donâ€™t promise any of those three though. ðŸ˜…

When Relay FM and St. Jude launched the community fundraiser tools last year, my mind began spinning about what I could do this year. Iâ€™ve been thinking about this marathon since then. Iâ€™m excited to try and raise money the best way I know how. I hope youâ€™ll hang out with me this month, but more importantly, I hope you will donate and help the kids.

[^1]: Okay, I donâ€™t have an arcade machine for *Mario Kart Arcade GP*. Or those remote controlled, build-your-own track RC cars. I do hear [Casey Liss owns those RC cars though](https://overcast.fm/+rAA9Plwo8/27:02).
[^2]: I also wonâ€™t be playing vanilla *Mario Kart 8* on Wii U. I was torn on this, but the Switch port is the same game with better performance and new racers. The tracks and functionality are identical though.
