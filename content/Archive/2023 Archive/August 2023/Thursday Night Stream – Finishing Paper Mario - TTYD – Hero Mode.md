[Trying to Finish Paper Mario TTYD: Hero Mode! + Dabbling with N64 MiSTer Core! | August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/tyyNkwtfoGw)

Picking up from last week, letâ€™s finish the Hero Mode demo for *The Thousand-Year Door* before my month long quest to [[Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM|race in every single Mario Kart game for Relay FM and St. Jude]] in September. You can read more about that marathon and check out the schedule [[Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM|here]]. The campaign has targets for adding more tracks through *Mario Kart 64: Amped Up!* and adding the All Cup in *Double Dash!!* You can [donate](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude) right now!

If we have some extra time, I may just check out the latest N64 core for the MiSTer projectâ€¦ðŸ¤”
