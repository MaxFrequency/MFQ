[PS VR2 Launch Set-Up and Games! | February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/tar6ivoqAeQ)

Last night, I streamed setting up and playing my new PlayStation VR2 headset for the first time. I don’t always link to my live streams here, but this one felt substantial enough to share. Minus the user error of forgetting there is a power button on the headset, the setup process is so simple. One cable[^1] and boom, you are off to the races. Which, I was with *Gran Turismo 7*. The sense of presence and speed is unlike any game I have ever played. It absolutely blew my mind. I had a blast hopping around games. If you are at all curious about PS VR2, I think my stream is worth a watch. I hope you enjoy!

[^1]: I did buy a 3′ USB-C extension cable, which seems to be the max length you can add on to the 14.5′ cord coming out of the headset itself.
