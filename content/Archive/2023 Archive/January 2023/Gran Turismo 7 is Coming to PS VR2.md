# Gran Turismo 7 is Coming to PS VR2

[Gran Turismo 7 and Beat Saber are coming to PSVR 2](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gran-turismo-7-and-beat-saber-are-coming-to-psvr-2/) by Jordan Middler for Video Games Chronicle

> Announced by President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan at CES, Gran Turismo 7 will arrive as a free upgrade at the launch of the headset.

You would be forgiven for not remembering PS VR2 launches next month. Heck, I only remember because I have a placeholder in my delivery tracking app. Sony’s launch of this platform is odd.

Why wasn’t this announced [[PlayStation VR2 launches in February at $549.99  – PlayStation.Blog|two months ago]] when the launch date and price were revealed? Another strange announcement for PS VR2. Were they holding off until both CES and [[Gran Turismo Movie Teaser Drops|the teaser]] for the movie was ready?

With both *GT7* and *[[Resident Evil Village VR launches February 22 for free – PlayStation.Blog|Resident Evil Village]]* as [[PlayStation VR2 launches in February at $549.99  – PlayStation.Blog|launch games]], I am more and more jazzed to get my hands on the device. We should get more hands-ons impressions from CES this week, I’d imagine.
