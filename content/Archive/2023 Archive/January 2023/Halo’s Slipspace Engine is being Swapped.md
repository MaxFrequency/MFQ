# Halo’s Slipspace Engine is being Swapped

[Microsoft Studio Behind Halo Faces a Reboot on Years of Turmoil](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise) by Jason Schreier for Bloomberg via [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579819/microsoft-layoffs-halo-343-industries-tatanka-unreal-engine)

> Chief among them is a pivot to a new gaming engine, the suite of tools and technology used to make video games. The studio’s own engine, known publicly as Slipspace, has been one of the biggest points of contention over the past two decades. Based largely on old code from the 1990s and early 2000s, it’s buggy and difficult to use and has been the source of headaches for some developers on Halo Infinite, people familiar with the development said. Several multiplayer modes that are nearly finished, such as Extraction and Assault, both popular in previous *Halo* games, have yet to be released in part because of issues involving the engine, they said.

> …it wasn’t until late last year, when previous studio head Bonnie Ross and engine lead David Berger departed and Pierre Hintze took over, that the firm finally decided to pivot to Unreal. This switch will start with a new game code-named Tatanka

RIP to the dopest game engine name out there.

I was surprised to read Slipspace is based of code from 20 years ago. Quick searching on [Halopedia](https://www.halopedia.org/Slipspace_Engine) indicates that Slipspace entered development in 2015~2018, but is derived off Bungie’s older Blam engine. That entered development in 1997, so that’s where the cruft lies.

Unreal started development in [1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine).

I’ll never forget the public name [reveal](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Fmdb-KmlzD8&t=88) of the Slipspace engine and *Halo Infinite*. What a shame that game was in such disarray. I still haven’t played the campaign, due to the lack of co-op at launch. I think it’s fixed now, but it feels too late now.
