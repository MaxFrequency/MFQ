# Splinter Cell Conviction is being Delisted on Xbox

[Microsoft announces plans to delist various games from the Xbox 360 marketplace](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-announces-plans-to-delist-various-games-from-the-xbox-360-marketplace/) by Tom Ivan for Video Games Chronicle

> Microsoft has announced plans to delist various games and associated DLC from the Xbox 360 marketplace next month…
> 
> …Removals will begin on February 7, 2023. Microsoft also noted that once purchased, players can always redownload games from their Xbox 360 Download History.

This is why I stand by purchasing my games physically. At least Microsoft is keeping downloads available for those that have bought the games. For now.

*Splinter Cell Conviction* is sublime action-stealth. The black and white visuals combined with the mark and execute commands created a bodacious game.

Other notable games I see are the *Left 4 Dead* games, *Limbo*, *Peggle 2*, *Dark Souls*, *Spelunky*, and *The Orange Box*.
