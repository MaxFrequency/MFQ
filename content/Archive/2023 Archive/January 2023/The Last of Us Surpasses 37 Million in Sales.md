# The Last of Us Surpasses 37 Million in Sales

[Reflecting on a Big Year to Come for *The Last of Us*](https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_10th_anniversary_kickoff) by Neil Druckmann for Naughty Dog

> We are so proud to share that the entire *The Last of Us* franchise has sold through more than 37 million copies globally as of December 2022, and is continuing to reach new and old players every day.

I wonder what the split is on the three (soon to be four) platform versions of the first game and Part II. We know as of October 2019, that *The Last of Us* had [sold 20 million copies](https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1183442551824666625). We also know that [*Part II* sold 10 million units](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/09/the-growing-future-of-the-last-of-us/) as of Spring 2022. I suppose the only unknown is how much of the remaining 7 million is the *Part I* remake for PS5. Very curious to see how the TV show impacts future sales too.
