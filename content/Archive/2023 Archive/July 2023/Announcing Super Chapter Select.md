We have been working on Super Chapter Select for nearly two years now. The first journal entry I have fleshing out the idea is dated November 29, 2021. We began production in earnest with [[S3 - Banjo-Kazooie|Season 3 – Banjo-Kazooie]]. That’s also when we planned on launching the membership alongside [[S6 - Pokémon|Season 6 – Pokémon]].

You could say this has been a long time coming. Logan and I have made shows together for over eight years. We love podcasting together and producing the best show possible. We now feel like we have a special show and offering for fans to directly support the us and the program. Down below is a list of FAQs that should help out.

Producing a premium show has been a goal of mine for over five years. I’ve been studying memberships and shows I adore to understand what makes them appealing to me and their audiences. I wanted to take our time and build our show right. I set out to apply their best principles in a way that fits our show and gives our audience a wonderful product at a fair price.

Thank you for joining us for this next chapter. We hope you enjoy!
