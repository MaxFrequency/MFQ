# Announcing the Next Three Seasons of Chapter Select

It is a big day here for Chapter Select. We’ve just launched Super Chapter Select, a member-supported version of the show; for just $20 a year, gain access to longer shows, exclusive episodes, and bonus videos. You can read more about Super Chapter Select in that dedicated post and sign up for it here. Alongside Super though, we are announcing the next three seasons of Chapter Select. We want to start announcing our plans ahead of time so that members know what they are signing up for the year ahead. Without further ado, here are Seasons 6, 7, and 8 of our show.
# Season 6 is *Pokémon*

It is time to fill up that Pokédex as we play through all of the mainline Pokémon games. This season has been in the works since last summer. We chose Pokémon to launch alongside Super Chapter Select. The season and the membership program have been designed hand-in-hand. It has been hard to keep this one a secret for so long.

We are bouncing between the games and remakes on a generational basis. This allowed us to play new or old versions of games without having to worry. Season 6 starts on August 23, 2023. You can see the whole schedule, guest list, and more [[S6 - Pokémon|here]].
# Season 7 is *Metroid Prime*

Next year’s theme is “Metroidvania” with a slight tweak on the “Metroid” part of the name. For our Spring 2024 season, we are adventuring across space in the *Metroid Prime* game series; yes that includes *Federation Force*.

This first-person reinvention of the 2D classic took the gaming world by storm back in 2002. With the brand new remaster and the ever impending *Metroid Prime 4*, we thought now was the perfect time to see if *Prime* is worth the praise or better off in limbo.

Season 7 will bounce us through the home console and portable games. This let’s us experience the core trilogy’s story in order, while not neglecting the on-the-go titles. You can see the entire season order [[S7 - Metroid Prime|here]].
# Season 8 is *Castlevania*

As for Fall 2024, we are taking on the Lord of Darkness himself, Lord Dracula, in the *Castlevania* series. This season will be 19 episodes in length, which is nearly double the previous record holder [[S5 - Resident Evil|Season 5 – Resident Evil]]. We could have doubled it, but we are omitting the original Game Boy games.[^1]

The structure for this season is unique, even for Chapter Select. We have that bouncing back and forth, but rather than by release dates or the chronological narrative, we chose eras/genres of design. Those eras are “Classic,” with titles ranging from the NES to the Sega Genesis; “Iga,” which focuses on Koji Igarashi’s legendary design; and “3D,’ which will take a look at the 3D entires scattered throughout the franchise.

We feel this gives the season a fun and interesting pace, while also allowing us to answer the question of “what really makes a *Castlevania* game?” You can see the entire season order here.

As for guests in 2024, we do not have any lined up. We have lots of great people in mind and I hope they are willing to join us. We will be reaching out to them soon. If you would like to join us for either Season 7 or 8, please reach out to me at max@maxfrequency.net or on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/MaxRoberts143).

These seasons do have exciting Super Chapter Select content planned! While we won’t be revealing them at this time, I am incredibly excited to produce them alongside the seasons for our members.

This is an exciting time for Chapter Select, Logan, and myself. We have been and will continue to pour ourselves into this show. Thank you for listening, watching, and supporting us. We hope you enjoy *Pokémon* and the Year of Metroidvania!

[^1]: Logan really doesn’t like OG Game Boy games. Except for *Pokémon*, I suppose. I was able to weasel *Mirror of Fate* on there though, thanks to the HD version.
