# The Cross-Generational Bottleneck - Ratchet & Clank Edition

[Digital Foundry](https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1684224949815328769) via [Video shows Ratchet & Clank PC port struggling to run on a PS4 HDD](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/video-shows-ratchet-clank-pc-port-struggling-to-run-on-a-ps4-hdd/) by Jordan Middler for VGC

It’s been a [[The Cross-Generational Bottleneck - Cyberpunk Edition|while]] since I’ve shared a [[The Cross-Generational Bottleneck|bottleneck]] post, but I think we understand why Sony and Insomniac didn’t make *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* a cross gen game. It seems like we are *finally* moving away from cross gen titles with *Spider-Man 2* here in October. Microsoft is [done developing Xbox One games](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/15/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty), banking on streaming to provide those users with access.
