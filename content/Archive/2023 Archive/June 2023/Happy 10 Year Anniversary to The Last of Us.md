# Happy 10 Year Anniversary to *The Last of Us*

Ten years ago, my summer kicked off with a game that would change my life and countless others. Who knew a decade ago that I’d name [[Eloise Siobhan Roberts|my daughter]] after Ellie.

I don’t have anything big planned for today. I should, but have just run out of time. I just wanted to acknowledge this significant milestone. 

If you’d like to see, read, or listen to any of my coverage on The Last of Us or Naughty Dog, check out [[Chasing the Stick – The History of Naughty Dog|my hub for Chasing the Stick]]. The franchise is bigger than ever today with the TV show and [[History is Repeating Itself|inevitable]] *Part III*. The multiplayer game is in [[The Last of Us Factions Multiplayer Game Delayed|limbo]], becoming [[Exploring Development Time for Naughty Dog’s PlayStation Catalog|the studio’s longest developed game to date]].

*The Last of Us* has stood the test of time and will be around for many more years to come. Congratulations to Neil, Bruce, and the team at Naughty Dog. Endure and survive indeed.
