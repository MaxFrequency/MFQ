# A Small Update

Hi everyone! I felt the need to give a small update. I havenâ€™t posted too much of the written word here lately and without Twitter in my life, I thought touching base would be a good idea. It all boils down to one wordâ€”busy. Iâ€™ve been cranking out quite a few episodes of both [[The Max Frequency Podcast]] and [[Chapter Select]]. My joby job takes time. And my family has some (very good) big life stuff happening that I will share soon.

I promise I will review the last two episode of HBOâ€™s *The Last of Us*. Itâ€™s been a mental block of sorts, due in particular to my disappointment. ðŸ˜¬ Thatâ€™s the beauty of this site though. I can write at my *frequency*.

Here are some things in the pipeline that Iâ€™ve got hitting the site soon.

- Two new episodes of MFP. Iâ€™m recording one of them today!
- [[S5 - Resident Evil|Chapter Select Season 5]] is nearing the end. Logan and I are knee deep in the Resident Evil 4 remake and are going to be starting RE5 together.
- The end of Season 5 also means my seasonal Behind the Scenes post (which I need to start writing ðŸ˜…). This season is going to be a doozy. We also have a big reveal planned too. ðŸ‘€

And here are just some quick thoughts on some recent news I wanted to comment on.

*Tears of the Kingdom* finally revealed its [gameplay and hook](https://youtu.be/a6qna-ZCbxA). Nintendo is leaning deeper into the sandbox. The jokes about *Nuts & Bolts* are spot on. Iâ€™m actually glad [[S3E2 - Banjo-Kazooie - Nuts & Bolts|I played that game last year]] to have a real point of comparison. Feels a little wild that the game is out in just six weeks. And that [beautiful Switch OLED](https://youtu.be/O1NqcD_QAuw) is out in just four! Yes, I ordered one. We are a three Switch household now.

Apple gave [dates for WWDC 2023](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/). The keynote is on June 5 and everything is pointing to Appleâ€™s headset being revealed. Happy birthday to me! Besides the new product, I am curious about iPadOS and macOS. I have stayed away from Ventura; primarily due to System Preferences turning into Settings. I wonder if the new version will entice me to update. As for iPadOS, the launch of Stage Manager was botched. I suspect a major pivot, but maybe Apple digs in their heels and pushes forward. Maybe we will finally see the Apple Silicon Mac Pro tooâ€¦

Summer is ramping up. Video game and tech news is gonna start popping. Iâ€™m getting amped. Iâ€™m thankful for this site as a place to lean into that excitement. Looking forward to the weeks and months ahead. I hope you are too.
