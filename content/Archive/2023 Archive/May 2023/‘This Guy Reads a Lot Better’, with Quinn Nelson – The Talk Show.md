# ‘This Guy Reads a Lot Better’, with Quinn Nelson – The Talk Show

[‘This Guy Reads a Lot Better’, with Quinn Nelson](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2023/04/26/ep-373) by John Gruber for The Talk Show

> Special guest Quinn Nelson joins the show to talk about Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset, Apple silicon, and more.

No, this is not an episode of *MFP*. I wish! Seeing Quinn be a guest on *The Talk Show* made me quite happy. I’ve been watching and following Quinn’s work for nearly a decade.[^1] I would wager that being on *The Talk Show* is a dream most Apple fans, observers, commentators. As someone who looks up to both these fine folks, I felt pride listening to Quinn. Maybe someday I’ll get to talk to both of them.[^2]

Plus, all their discussion on Apple’s VR/AR headset is spot on. This is a must listen before WWDC in one month.
