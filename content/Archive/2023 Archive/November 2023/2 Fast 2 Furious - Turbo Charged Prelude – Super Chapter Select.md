Hello everybody! Back in July, Logan and I [[Announcing Super Chapter Select|announced Super Chapter Select]]. It's a member-supported tier of the show with longer shows, exclusive episodes, and bonus videos. As we wind down [[S6 - Pokémon|Season 6 – Pokémon]] here, we decided to release a special from each season during these interstitial weeks.

This week, I'm putting out us watching the *2 Fast 2 Furious: Turbo Charged Prelude* short film. We also watched the Los Bandoleros short film, as well as produced movie commentaries for *2 Fast 2 Furious* and *Fast Five*. [[S4 - The Fast and The Furious|Season 4 – The Fast and the Furious]] also has an [[S4E12 - Better Luck Tomorrow|exclusive episode]] discussing *Better Luck Tomorrow*, one of Justin Lin's first films and Han's first appearance. We hope you enjoy seeing this stuff. 

If you'd like to see everything we have to offer, you can sign up for Super Chapter Select right now! It is only [$2.50 per month](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=99142) or [$20 a year](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=76115)! You'll get access to nearly 30 hours of member-exclusive material across almost all our seasons. I'm real proud of what we make and I think you'll enjoy it.
