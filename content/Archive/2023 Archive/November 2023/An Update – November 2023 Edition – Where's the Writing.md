# An Update – November 2023 Edition – Where's the Writing?

I feel due for a life update here on Max Frequency. I entered September and it feels like all my time has vanished. Without being active on Twitter, I feel this strange disconnection from sharing where I am at in my work and creative process. Heck, even just my takes on *Spider-Man 2* or a deep dive on the Analogue 3D.

It's all stuff I want to write, but I just haven't had/made the time.

September was a blur of [charity streams for St. Jude and Relay FM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCxW3Sbhy5Y-xHm1ZiPAZsO3gZYqYPf7). I still want to write my post-analysis on how that went from the creative side. Chapter Select kept on trucking with [[S6 - Pokémon|Season 6 – Pokémon]]. We still have to record the last two episodes.

To bury the lede a bit, I lost my job three weeks ago. I'm good now and have already found work. I am fortunate to have had such help getting back so quickly. Then Abby and I were sick for a solid week. Totally just cleaned our clock and deleted a week from our lives. I hate having my time robbed like that.

I've got some projects in the works. I do have a deep dive on the Analogue 3D in the research phase. Lots to read and dig into. I'm working on adapting my [[Uncharted 3’s Chateau and the Art of Escalation|Art of Escalation]] piece into a video essay. That seemed like a good one to adapt and dip my toes into a more polished video. I continue to work on [[Chapter Select]] and find guests for [[The Max Frequency Podcast|MFP]]. I've had a dream slate lately and am super proud of those episodes. I'm currently reaching out to some folks in hopes of episodes.

Thanks for indulging this brief catch-up. I have felt it as a strange burden looming. Now that it's out there, I can get back on track and keep making the stuff I love.

Update (like two minutes after publishing): Oh yeah. I’ve also begun the slow process of manually archiving all my online writing in Markdown and linking it all in Obsidian. It’s already led to some great and neat discoveries and recoveries. More soon.
