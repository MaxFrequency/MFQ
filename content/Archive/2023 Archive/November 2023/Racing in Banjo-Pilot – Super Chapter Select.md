Hello everybody! Back in July, Logan and I [[Announcing Super Chapter Select|announced Super Chapter Select]]. It's a member-supported tier of the show with longer shows, exclusive episodes, and bonus videos. A failure on our part was to not really show that content to our audience. We figured the concept was ubiquitous in the space, that the promise of that content was enough.

Now, that feels rather foolish on my part. I think we are making some neat stuff and potential members should know what they are paying to get access for. So in the coming weeks, we are opening the gates a bit.

In the interstitial weeks between [[S6 - PokÃ©mon|Season 6 - PokÃ©mon]] episodes, we'll be releasing one member special video to the public from each season. This week, we are starting with one of the first videos we made.

Using the power of the MiSTer FPGA platform, Logan and I raced in *Banjo-Pilot*, the GBA racing game that we did not play for [[S3 - Banjo-Kazooie|Season 3 - Banjo-Kazooie]]. We filmed this last May when Logan was in town for a work trip. We also filmed Logan playing *Grunty's Revenge* for the first time and our *FireRed/LeafGreen* PokÃ©mon battle (which you will see in a few weeks ðŸ˜‰).

We hope you enjoy seeing this stuff. It's going to be neat to see how the quality and style grows over the course of the seasons. When we made this, we didn't even have a name picked out! I was figuring out game audio versus our own. It ought to be a neat display of the show's production growth.

If you'd like to see everything we have to offer, you can sign up for Super Chapter Select right now! It is only [$2.50 per month](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=99142) or [$20 a year](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=76115)! You'll get access to nearly 30 hours of member-exclusive material across almost all our seasons. I'm real proud of what we make and I think you'll enjoy it.
