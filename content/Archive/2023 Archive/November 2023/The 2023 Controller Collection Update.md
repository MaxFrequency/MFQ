# The 2023 Controller Collection Update

It is that time of the year again. While I have moved [[When did I get so many Controllers?|again]], I don't have a snazzy layout photo of all my controllers; maybe next year? There have been some interesting changes this time around, and I have a correction to [[The 2022 Controller Collection Update|last year's tally]]. 

Last year, I claimed that I only added a secondary DualSense. That's not accurate. I also bought the *Splatoon 3* OLED Switch console, so I added those beautiful Joy-Con to the collection. I did sell the pink and green Joy-Con to help pay for that console, so the total remained the same, but I did have newer Joy-Con.

And we have the same situation this year. Of course I was going to buy the *Tears of the Kingdom* OLED Switch. So I have added those Zelda Joy-Con to the collection *and* the *Tears of the Kingdom* Switch Pro controller. I still only had my launch Pro Controller, so I figured now was a good time to buy a second one.

The Zelda-themed Switch wasn't the only new hardware I brought into the fold. I also bought the PlayStation VR 2 headset, which of course came with its own controllers. Now that I have the physical space, I need to get back into VR gaming.

My in-laws gave me some of their old consoles, an NES and a PS2. Those came with their own sets on used and abused controllers. I'm serious about the abuse. Some of the PS2 controllers have been chewed to high heaven. 

My own parents finally gave me their SNES Classic that they ended up buying. So we can add those Wii remote plug styled SNES controllers to the mix as well.

The big controller acquisition of the year was a glorious garage sale find. I was able to find a Rock Band set for PS3â€”wireless drums, guitar, and micâ€”the whole shebang for $50. I just need another guitar for a bass player to have the band back together. 

Before adding up the new total, we need to say goodbye to those we lost this year, or more accurately, those we sold. I did a little house keeping this year to pay for my [[Switching Things Up â€“ Extron Crosspoint Thoughts & Impressions|Extron Crosspoint switch]] and the upcoming RetroTINK 4K. I sold off my Super NT with the 2.4 Ghz SNES controller I bought for it. I also parted ways with my *Splatoon 3* Switch and those gorgeous Joy-Con. That hurt the most.

At the end of it all, this year was big for collecting controllers. I went from 58 to 70. ðŸ˜¬ I feel like triple digits are in my future before too long. Thank God I have the space for them now, right?
