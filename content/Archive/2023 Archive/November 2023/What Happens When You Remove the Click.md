# What Happens When You Remove the Click

Last week, the defunct group Daft Punk put out a new mix of one of my favorite albums dubbed the "Random Access Memories (Drumless Edition)." It's leans the total opposite way of Giovanni Giorgio's interview during my favorite track Giorgio by Moroder.

> And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track, which then was synced to the Moog Modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realize how much the impact would be. 

I love that song so much, I had to mention it when I chatted with Robert Ashley earlier [[MFP24 - “The Power of Radio” with Robert Ashley|this year]].
