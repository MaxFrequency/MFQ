# I'm Coming Back to Being a Content Creator – insaneintherainmusic

>Now I've realized that the burnout and the difficult feelings that I was experiencing weren't necessarily because of the specific work that I was doing, but more so about the mindset I had while I was doing it.  

It seems like Carlos and I have had similar journeys, although he is far more successful at it. [[I’m Done Being a Content Creator – insaneintherainmusic|After roughly 22 months]] and a few albums, Carlos Eiene is back making video game music covers on his YouTube channel.

I, too, left writing and podcasting for a stint feeling burnt out. It took some time for me to realize that I do want to write and podcast; I just had to find it on my own terms.

I'm thrilled Carlos is back and I cannot wait to hear what he cooks up.
