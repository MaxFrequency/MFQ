[Dead Space â€“ Spooky Season Stream | October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/PGfxg3Wvgrc)

Continuing the theme of dabbling with the spooky season by trying out the *Dead Space* remake on PS5. I read the ESRB description this time, so there should be no mature surprises. ðŸ˜…

I haven't played *Dead Space* in over a decade. I've always touted it as a titan in survival horror. Based off reviews, that stands, but it will be nice to experience it for myself again with this dramatic new coat of paint. Also, I fixed the audio issues, so I'll be able to use headphones and avoid bleed for you all. 

Come [swing by the stream](http://maxfrequency.live/) tonight at 7:00 PM EST to hang out and cut some aliens in half.
