# My Conversation with ChatGPT about FCP

Me

I need help with Final Cut Pro on my Mac. I am trying to take one movie clip and track it's position and scale to a face in another clip. I want this first clip to move, grow, etc. and the clip beneath (with the face to be tracked) moves and grows. Currently, when I use the tracker built in to Final Cut Pro, the first clip just stays put in the corner while the face and tracker move. I just want the clip to adhere to the tracker and scale appropriately. Do you have any ideas how to solve this?

It sounds like you're trying to perform motion tracking and apply the tracked motion to one clip while keeping another clip underneath it. The issue you're facing might be due to the order in which you're applying the tracking and the scaling. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve your desired effect in Final Cut Pro:

1. Import Your Clips:
	Import both the clip you want to track (the first clip) and the clip with the face (the second clip) into your Final Cut Pro project.
2. Place Clips in Timeline:
	Drag both clips to the timeline. Make sure the clip with the face is placed on a lower track (usually V1), and the clip you want to track is on a higher track (e.g., V2).
3. Apply Motion Tracking:
	Select the clip you want to track (the second clip with the face). Go to the "Video" tab in the Inspector (if it's not visible, click the "Inspector" button in the top-right corner of the Final Cut Pro window). Click the "Add" button (+) under the "Tracking" section to add a new tracker. Select "Analyzing Motion" from the drop-down menu and click "Apply." Adjust the tracker's size and position to encompass the face you want to track. Click the "Analyze" button to start the motion analysis. Let Final Cut Pro analyze the motion in the clip.
4. Apply the Tracked Data:
	Once the analysis is complete, select the clip you want to track (the first clip) on the higher track (V2).
	In the "Video" tab of the Inspector, under the "Transform" section, you should see a parameter called "Match Move." This is where you'll apply the tracked data.
	Click the "Apply Match Move" checkbox. The tracked data from the second clip will now be applied to the first clip.
5. Adjust Scaling and Positioning:
	You can now adjust the scaling, position, and rotation of the first clip to make it align with the tracked movement. Use the "Scale," "Position," and "Rotation" parameters under the "Transform" section in the Inspector.
6. Fine-Tuning:
	Depending on the complexity of the shot and the accuracy of the tracking, you might need to make some manual adjustments to ensure the first clip aligns perfectly with the tracked motion.

Remember that the quality of your tracking will depend on the accuracy of your initial tracking points and the complexity of the motion. For more advanced tracking and compositing, you might need to explore other software or techniques.

If you're still encountering issues, you can also consider checking online tutorials or user guides specific to your version of Final Cut Pro, as software interfaces and features might have changed after my last knowledge update in September 2021.
