[Racing in Every Mario Kart Game Ever for Relay FM and St. Jude! - GameCube & DS | September 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/kHgc3z4ZZrA)

Tonight we continue our journey through all the *Mario Kart* games with my childhood favorites—*Double Dash!!* and *DS*. I haven’t played though these games in years, but I have no doubt I spent the most time with them. The double driver and special items of *Double Dash!!* still reign supreme in my eyes. I am absolutely thrilled to come back to these!

And all of this is for the fine folks over at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. September is childhood cancer awareness month. The fine folks at Relay FM partner up with them every year to raise money. This year, I decided to do more than just [donate](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude). You can read some more about it [[Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM|here]].

There is still so much of September left! You can [donate in the polls](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude) I set up to help pick the speed I race at in each game! Tonight’s slate includes Mirror Mode in both games, if you really want to contribute to breaking my childhood brain. We also reached the milestone to tackle the All Cup in *Double Dash!!* as well, so we are getting a double dose of the definitive title. I’ll also be making up last week’s bonus with *Mario Kart 64: Amped Up!*. I’m feeling much better this week. ☺️ It’s going to be a jammed packed night of classic *Mario Kart* shenanigans and, more importantly, donations to help the kids. Hope you’ll tune in and consider [donating](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude)!
