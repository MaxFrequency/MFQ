[Racing in Every Mario Kart Game Ever for Relay FM and St. Jude! - Wii and 3DS | September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/fUZdAV7mDu0)

Tonight we continue our journey through all the Mario Kart games with the motion-control sensation *Mario Kart Wii* and the *Diddy Kong Racing* clone that is *Mario Kart 7*. I’ll also be wrapping up the retro cups from *Mario Kart DS*. Have to clear the slate for next week’s *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* finale stream!

The stream will be a smidge delayed. Had a personal scheduling conflict. I’ll be starting sometime between 7:00 PM EST and 8:00PM EST. My apologies!

And all of this is for the fine folks over at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. September is childhood cancer awareness month. The fine folks at Relay FM partner up with them every year to raise money. This year, I decided to do more than just [donate](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude). You can read some more about it [[Streaming Every Single Mario Kart for St. Jude and Relay FM|here]].

There is still some of September left! We had a major donation happen over the weekend! Any amount helps with kids. You can [donate in the polls](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude) I set up to help pick the speed I race at in each game! I no longer have my original *Mario Kart Wii* save data, so we are actually going to be unlocking everything we need live! It’s going to be a blast tonight. Hope you’ll tune in and consider [donating](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude)!
