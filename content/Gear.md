Here is a list of all the hardware and software that I use on a regular basis: Both for this site and in my personal life. I’ve always enjoyed reading other people’s list and researching what will fit my needs (or just be rad to have). So I wanted to make and share my own list.

And now there is a snazzy video tour of the space and gear as well. I hope you enjoy.

# Computer

I use a pink/red [M1 iMac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111895) with 16GB of unified memory and a 2TB SSD. It is occasionally plugged into my [LG 24QP500-B 24” monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-24qp500-b-ips-monitor). I use an [Anker Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087219P5J/?ie=UTF8). I back my computer and my five external drives to [BackBlaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/027223).

Now I use an Apple Magic Keyboard with TouchID and Magic Trackpad, but I still have a [Keychron K2 Keyboard](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with red switches and a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005620.html). I also have a [Canon TS9120](https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/pixma-ts9120), which is a nifty printer.
# Cameras and Microphones

My main microphone is a [Shure Beta 87A](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/beta_87a) microphone plugged into a [Zoom H6](https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h6-audio-recorder/) with a USB Micro to USB-C cable. I use [Audio-Technica ATH-M40X](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/ath-m40x) headphones to listen through the H6.

I also have a few microphones I use when I’m on-site filming for one of my jobs. I have a [Sennheiser AVX-MKE2](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/camera-wireless-lavalier-microphone-system-set-avx-mke2), a [Rode Wireless GO gen 1](https://www.rode.com/blog/all/meet-wireless-go), and a [Rode NTG-2 Shotgun](http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntg-2) mic.

I have a [Canon 90D](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-90d-body) for filming with the kit 18-55mm and 55-250mm lenses. I use a [Sigma F1.8 18-35mm zoom](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/a013_18_35_18/) now with the creamiest bokeh. I also got my Dad’s old Minolta lenses and bought an adapter plate for Canon: those lenses are a 28mm prime and a 50mm prime.

For my iMac, I use my iPhone 15 Pro Max with [Camo](https://reincubate.com/camo/). I use an [Elgato pop-up green screen](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/green-screen) for live streams.
# Video Games

As for modern consoles, I currently have a PS5 with a 1TB SSD installed, a Xbox Series X, and a *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* Nintendo Switch OLED with a 256GB micro SD card installed.

My more “retro” consoles include a NES, a SNES, a N64, [[Building My Dream GameCube|two GameCubes]], a Wii, a [[Hot, Fresh Homebrewed Consoles|Wii U]], a couple of Game Boy handhelds, a Game Boy Color, Advance, Micro, a DS Lite, a *Majora's Mask*-themed New 3DS XL, a PS1, a PS2, a PS3, a PSP-1000, a [[Preserving the Vita – Upgrading My Vita TV|PS Vita]], a [[Preserving the Vita – Upgrading My Vita TV|PS TV]], and a [[MiSTer FPGA Thoughts and Impressions – My Tool for Researching the Past|MiSTer FPGA console]].

For capturing game footage, I have an Elgato [4K60S+](https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-4k60-s-plus), an [Elgato HD60 X](https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-hd60-x), and an [Elgato Game Capture HD](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/elgato-game-capture-hd-1090584/review). I keep the older model around for its ability to capture analog video from older game systems. 

The TV I use is a [LG C1 55″ 4K OLED](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled55c1pub-oled-4k-tv) plugged into an LG 2.1 soundbar. You can read about my previous TV the [[Calibrating for the Next Generation – LG C9 4K OLED TV Thoughts & Impressions|LG C9]] here.

I also have a [Sony Trinitron KV-27FS12](https://www.cnet.com/products/sony-wega-kv-27fs12/) that my wife graciously lets me keep in the home for my older consoles. I use an [[Switching Things Up – Extron Crosspoint Thoughts & Impressions|Extron Crosspoint Matrix Switch]] to spit out the video signal from my analog consoles to both TVs. Now I don’t have to choose between playing off the CRT or plugging into my RetroTINK 4K and RetroTINK 5X-Pro for crispy upscaled capture. Here's [[Rewiring - Preparing the Way for Tink 4K|how I wire it all up]] to my TV.
