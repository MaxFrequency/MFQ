# Hello everybody.

And welcome to Max Frequency. My home on the Internet since 2013. It's had different names and been published in other places, but it's always been demonstrably *[[About|me]]*.

Most of the site is about video games and my thoughts and impressions of said video games. It all started when [[Max Birthday GameBoy.jpg|I got a Game Boy Color]] at a Chuck E. Cheese. I haven't stopped since. 

You will also find other musings on technology, film, and other fine proclivities. I talk a lot about the game developer [[Chasing the Stick – The History of Naughty Dog|Naughty Dog]]. There are plenty of [[Podcasts|podcasts]] too. To sum it up (like I said above), you will find me. 

I hope you enjoy.
