# BTP1 - Kirk Hamilton – From Jazz Teacher to Game Journalist

> [!info]
> Part of creating *The Max Frequency Podcast* was to restore all the episodes of *Behind the Pixel*, an interview show I did in 2017 for seven episodes. These will be mixed into this feed so that the show can live on podcast services once more. Below are the original show notes, with some light editing. I hope you enjoy.

In this inaugural episode of my new long form interview show, I sat down with editor-at-large of Kotaku, Kirk Hamilton. We discuss Kirk’s background in jazz music, his journalism career at Kotaku, and how it all jives together. Tune in as I pick Kirk’s brain and learn more about one of raddest reviewers in the video game industry.

Follow Kirk on Twitter [@KirkHamilton](http://twitter.com/kirkhamilton) and his work over at [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/).
