> Part of creating *The Max Frequency Podcast* was to restore all the episodes of *Behind the Pixel*, an interview show I did in 2017 for seven episodes. These will be mixed into this feed so that the show can live on podcast services once more. Below are the original show notes, with some light editing. I hope you enjoy.

In this episode of Behind the Pixel, I figure out who the heck Alex O’Neill really is. Ever since [[Millennial Gaming Speak – Episode 77 - Why We Want Careers in Games Media|he replaced me on Millennial Gaming Speak]] the weekend I got engaged, I’ve heard rumblings of a fly guy that podcasts for hours on end, knows Greg Miller, and has some thought-provoking things to say about video games. Listen in as I chat with Alex and learn about his living portfolio—Irrational Passions—and the future of the industry.

Follow Alex on Twitter @AlFighter27 and his work over at Irrational Passions.
