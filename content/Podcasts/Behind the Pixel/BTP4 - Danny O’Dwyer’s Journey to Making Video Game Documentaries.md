# BTP4 - Danny O’Dwyer’s Journey to Making Video Game Documentaries

> [!info]
> Part of creating *The Max Frequency Podcast* was to restore all the episodes of *Behind the Pixel*, an interview show I did in 2017 for seven episodes. These will be mixed into this feed so that the show can live on podcast services once more. Below are the original show notes, with some light editing. I hope you enjoy.

Join Max as he turns the microphone around on the founder of Noclip, Danny O’Dwyer. In September 2016, Danny left his job at Gamespot to pursue a passion for sharing stories through documentaries focused on video games. Max explores Danny’s history of using video to tell stories and discusses the future of Noclip, while learning a bit about the documentary process itself. So sit down, grab a pint, and listen to us interview the interviewer.

Like, we were interviewing people and they were like happy we were doing this.” – Danny O’Dwyer from [his vlog about Noclip’s first six months](https://youtu.be/vm7D0i8SdjE).
