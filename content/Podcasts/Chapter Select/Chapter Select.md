Chapter Select is a seasonal, retrospective podcast. Hosts [[About|Max Roberts]] and [Logan Moore](http://twitter.com/mooreman12) pick a series to bounce back and forth between its entries, exploring their evolution, design, and legacy. Each season focuses on a different series with guests joining along the way to discuss and examine media outside of individual titles.

We want to be the very best; like no podcast ever was! Welcome to Season 6 of Chapter Select! It is time for us to catch them all as we tackle *Pokémon*. “Rivals” Max Roberts and Logan Moore set out on a grand adventure to collect, battle, and study this legendary series.

Welcome to Season 5 of Chapter Select! Logan Moore brings Max Roberts under Capcom’s horror umbrella and guides him through this nightmarish franchise. Clear out your inventory. Turn off the lights. It’s time for…*Resident Evil*!

Logan has never been a part of the Fast Family, while Max has been riding with the crew since the Miami days. Grab a Corona, order a tuna fish sandwich, and buckle up as we explore this legendary series.
# [[S3 - Banjo-Kazooie|Season 3 - Banjo-Kazooie]]

![[S3 Art.jpg]]

*Banjo-Kazooie* is a unique series with so few entries. From the warm, fuzzy glow of the N64 to the crispness of XSX, Season 3 aims to figure out if Banjo-Threeie needs to be made or if fans are just cuckoo.
# [[S2 - God of War|Season 2 - God of War]]

![[S2 Art.jpg]]

*God of Wa*r is one of PlayStation Studios’ strongest series. Before *Ragnarök*, Season 2 goes back to see how Kratos has (and hasn’t) changed over the last 15 years.
# [[S1 - Paper Mario|Season 1 - Paper Mario]]

![[S1 Art.jpg]]

Thanks to the power of the Wii U, Season 1 is all about Nintendo’s paper-stylized RPG series that has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.
# [[S0 - The Last of Us|Season 0 - The Last of Us]]

Hot off the heels of *The Last of Us Part II*, Max and Logan decided to test Chapter Select’s format with Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic series.
