Chapter Select Season 0 is *The Last Of Us*. During the wild success of the *Uncharted* series on PlayStation 3, Naughty Dog took a risk creating a character-driven post-apocalyptic adventure. The swan song of the console became the most awarded game of all time. Seven years later, a divisive sequel capped off the PlayStation 4 generation.
