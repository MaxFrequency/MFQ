# Season 3 – *Banjo-Kazooie*

![[S3 Art.jpg]]

Chapter Select Season 3 is *Banjo-Kazooie*. This unique series has so few entries, but a passionate fan base. From the warm, fuzzy glow of the Nintendo 64 to the crispness of the Xbox Series X, the Bear and the Bird have helped shape 3D character platformers since 1998.
