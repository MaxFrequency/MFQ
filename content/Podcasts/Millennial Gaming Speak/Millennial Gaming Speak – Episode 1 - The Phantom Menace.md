The first two episodes of Millennial Gaming Speak are lost to time. I deleted my half of the audio to free up SSD space. It’s a real shame that these have been lost. In my effort to manually archive all my writing and work online, I decided to incorporate the show notes doc we wrote for these episodes. From there, I decided to publish the show notes so there is at least a record about what we discussed. Maybe some day I’ll magically find the audio…
