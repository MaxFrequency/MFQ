# Show Description

Fellow Citizens Mario Rivera and Michael Ruiz join Logan this week to talk about 4K TVs and the slew of recent releases such as Wolfenstein II, Super Mario Odyssey, and Assassin’s Creed Origins.

Afterwards, they break down Sony’s recent Paris Games Week presentation and give their thoughts on Sucker Punch’s new IP reveal, The Last of Us: Part II‘s brutal cinematic trailer, and the story trailer for Spider-Man that nearly made Logan cry.
