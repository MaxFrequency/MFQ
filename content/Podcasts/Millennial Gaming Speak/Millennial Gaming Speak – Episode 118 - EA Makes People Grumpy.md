# Show Description

Logan would like to inform all our listeners on where to meet for the raid, pillaging, and burning of EA will take place and what supplies to bring.

Or he’d like to share that it isn’t the end of the world, no matter how scummy it seems.

Logan shares his thoughts on Battlefront II with the show. Max and Michael chime in with their thoughts on the recent news and what everyone has been playing lately, including DOOM on Switch. Later, we throw our two cents in on the Game Awards and the nominees for 2017.
