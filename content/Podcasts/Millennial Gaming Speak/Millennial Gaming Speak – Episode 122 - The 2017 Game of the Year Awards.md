It’s finally here! Our long talked about and much-anticipated game of the year episode has arrived and it’s very, very, very long. Max and Logan are joined by citizens Mario Rivera and Michael Ruiz to hand out nearly 20 different awards to games that released this year. Which game will be crowned king of 2017?
