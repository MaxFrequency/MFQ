# Show Description

For the first time on MGS, we have a guest! Logan invited Trevor Thomas to join the show. Hear more about the IGN House Party and then dive into the news with the trio.

They talk *Battlefront* going live on Xbox first, despite Sony’s advertising control. Then the gang discusses *Rise of the Tomb Raider*‘s exclusivity window, Splatoon‘s major update, and *Street Fighter V*‘s failing beta.

We close the show with three topics. We hope you enjoy this jam packed episode that’s filled with discussion, jokes, and slick stories. Make sure to stick around until the very end too!

Follow Max and Logan on Twitter!
