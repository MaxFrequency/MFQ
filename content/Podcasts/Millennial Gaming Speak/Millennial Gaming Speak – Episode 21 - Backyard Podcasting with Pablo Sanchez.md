# Show Description

Getting back on a regular schedule, the MGS crew doesn’t have too much news to discuss this week. Despite that, they have a jam packed show!

Big-name FPS games are lacking campaigns, so Logan and Max weigh in on the future of the brands and the genre as a whole.

Max gives his full run-down on *Destiny: The Taken King*. Logan is curious about Playstation VR in the eyes of the consumer. To wrap up the show, the duo shares their top three boss battles!

Thanks for listening this week and make sure to…
