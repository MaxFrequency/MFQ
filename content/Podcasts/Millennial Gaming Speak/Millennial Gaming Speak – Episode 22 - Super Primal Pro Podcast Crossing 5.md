# Show Description

This week on Millennial Gaming Speak, Logan and Max discuss Microsoft’s vertical integration, a brand new *Far Cry* game, and how *Animal Crossing* amiibo are top notch.

The topic this week is how games have let us down in the past, like the brand new *Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5*. Anything from technical disasters to down right disappointments.

Thanks for listening this week and make sure to…

Intro and Outro song is “OHC3” by Kris Keyser

The break song is “Dearly Beloved” by Yoko Shimomura from “*Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep*“

There was a technical issue during the discussion of this week’s topic. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience. Just know that Max was right about *Mass Effect 1*.
