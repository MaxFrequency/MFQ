# Show Description

After an exciting and copyright infringed opening, Max, Logan and special guest this week Michael Jordan, talk about both *Super Smash Bros* and *Star Wars Battlefront*‘s upcoming DLC. In their Topical Topics segment, they think back on their fondest memories with local co-op/multiplayer games and discuss some of their favorite RPGs.

Lastly, the audio is a little bit off this week so please excuse our mistakes. Max’s audio drops out for a few minutes during our Bethesda discussion so now you’ll know why he isn’t speaking.
