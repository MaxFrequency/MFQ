# Show Description

In this short and sweet, news focused episode, Logan and Max discuss their hype for *Lego Star Wars- Episode VII: The Force Awakens*. Logan shares the details on *Fallout 4*‘s first DLC drops and Max breaks down the recent *Destiny 2* announcement/delay.

Rather than have a topic at the end of the show, Millennial Gaming Speak recorded a separate [*Firewatch* Review Discussion](obsidian://open?vault=Max%20Frequency%20Writing&file=2016%20Archive%2F1602%2FMillennial%20Gaming%20Speak%20%E2%80%93%20Firewatch%20Review%20Discussion)! Check it out!
