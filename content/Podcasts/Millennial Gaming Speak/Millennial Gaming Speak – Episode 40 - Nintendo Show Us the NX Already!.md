Max and Logan have finally returned after a couple weeks off and boy, there’s some catching up to do. The dynamic duo catch up on some recent news regarding the PS Neo. Logan then airs his frustration with Nintendo while Max tries to put the news about the NX into perspective. They end the show talking about *Uncharted 4* and look back at their favorite moments from the first three games in the series.

RIP Prince
