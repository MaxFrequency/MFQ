# Show Description

As E3 approaches, Logan and Max discuss the little news that has slipped through the cracks. *Destiny*‘s major expansion for 2016 has leaked, so Max gives his share on the new *[[Rise of Iron]]*. Microsoft seems to have entered the fray of interval console releases with new leaked information. *Mighty No. 9* is looking rough after its “Masterclass” trailer (link below).

After the news, the MGS crew shares their plans for a new, six-week long segment about their favorite games of all time!
