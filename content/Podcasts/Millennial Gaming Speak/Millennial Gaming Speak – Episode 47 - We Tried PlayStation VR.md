# Show Description

Max yawns a whole bunch. Besides that, the dudes finally got their grubby little hands on a PlayStation VR. They talk about the two games they demoed, *Eve Valkyrie* and *SuperHyperCube*.

Later, they count down their 10 favorite games from the current console generation. Yes, that means Max is going to gush about *Uncharted 4* again.
