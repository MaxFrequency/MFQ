# Show Description

Trevor Thompson returns to the podcast to fill in for Max and talks with Logan about his year away from the U.S. and what games he played upon returning home. We then take a hard, drastic turn into a discussion that has absolutely nothing to do with video games and talk about the current election season. If you don’t like politics, then feel free to ignore the second hour of the show this week. Our normal format will return next week.
