Hello! Have you been curious as to what I have been working on? Well let your curiosity be put to rest! I have been wrangling (I’ve always wanted to use that word!) up a gang to create an original podcast for Go Left Gaming. The result?

The Game Boys will be a bi-weekly podcast the releases on Mondays! We will discuss the gaming news that matters most to you! Along with a few shenanigans, you just can’t go wrong with our show!
