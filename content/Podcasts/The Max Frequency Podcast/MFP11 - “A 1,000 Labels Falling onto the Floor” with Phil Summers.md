# MFP11 - “A 1,000 Labels Falling onto the Floor” with Phil Summers

Phil Summers from Hand-Drawn Game Guides joins the show to talk about his first and wildly successful Kickstarter. From *Ninja Gaiden* to *Metroid*, we chat about his approach to writing a guide, as well as drawing them! We also celebrate the return of *Metroid* during the series’ 35th anniversary.
