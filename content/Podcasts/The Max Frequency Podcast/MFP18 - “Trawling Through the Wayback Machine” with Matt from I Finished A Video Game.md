When I watched I Finished A Video Game’s 7+ hour Castlevania retrospective, [[Castlevania Series Retrospective – I Finished A Video Game|I had to know how it was made]]. So I reached out to the creator, Matt, and invited him to the show. We talk about both the history of *Castlevania* and the daunting task of chronicling the entire franchise.

> [!info] Correction: 
> There is a [Saturn core](https://github.com/srg320/Saturn_MiSTer) in development for the MiSTer. I was thinking of the Dreamcast. I guess that’s what I get for never owning a Sega console.
