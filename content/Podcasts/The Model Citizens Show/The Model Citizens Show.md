# The Model Citizens Show

![[MCS.jpg]]

Back in 2017, Logan Moore, Michael Ruiz, Mario Rivera, and myself undertook launching our own podcast network—Model Citizens Media. The flagship show shared the name, dropping “Media” for “Show.” The network included four shows; said flagship with the four of us, [[Millennial Gaming Speak]] with Logan and myself (which [[Restoring Millennial Gaming Speak|I restored last year]]), Reeling in the Years with Logan and Mike, and [[Behind the Pixel]]. It wasn’t long for the world.

Now an occasional fare with Logan Moore, Michael Ruiz, Mario Rivera, Grant Callahan, and myself. The show originally ran from February 2017 through February 2018. In 2022, the boys decided to [[The Model Citizens Show has Been Revived|resurrect the show]] on a semi-monthly basis. You can find new episodes on the Point in Progress YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxEe--Q54HeknjfaQGbGCOw). Our old ones exist on the original [MCM channel](http://www.youtube.com/@modelcitizens6108).
