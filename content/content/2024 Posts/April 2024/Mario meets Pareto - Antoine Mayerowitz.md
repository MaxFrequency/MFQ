[Mario meets Pareto](https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/mario-meets-pareto) by Antoine Mayerowitz via [Andy Baio](https://waxy.org/2024/04/mario-meets-pareto/)

Saw this shared by a couple blogs, but Andy Baio wins by being first.[^1] This page is full of reactive charts and a whole lot of math that explains the why and how of best kart/driver combos in *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe*. 

Kinda nice to see my preferred driver[^2] is one that is never dominated on both speed and acceleration. I do with you could punch in your preferred combo and see where it lies in all this math. That'd be neat.

Also, I can't be the only person who keeps reading the title as "Mario Meets Partio," right?

[^1]: Maybe Andy optimized his blog sharing speed.
[^2]: Isabelle, who equates in speed and acceleration to my staple Toadette.
