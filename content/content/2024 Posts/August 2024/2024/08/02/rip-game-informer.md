What a shame to ostensively delete 33 years of news, previews, reviews, podcasts, etc. [GI's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gameinformer) is still up, but we shall see. I assume the Video Game History Foundation has a complete collection on their hands. Feels like the history and preservation of GI is in their hands.
