[*Grounded II: The Making of The Last of Us Part II* Trailer](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TxCrkSlOVa8)

I am thrilled to see this project come into the light. *Grounded: The Making of The Last of Us* was instrumental to writing [[../../../../../../chasing-the-stick/|Chasing the Stick: The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era]]. There are few better ways to understand the philosophy of a dev team than straight from the devs' mouth. 

While I do buy that COVID-19 stunted production on the doco, I couldn't help but crack up at the idea that the footage has been unearthed years later. *The Last of Us Part II* only came out three and a half years ago. It's not like the hard drives vanished. Quite frankly, the story is maybe just now coming to a sense of resolution and understanding. That's one of the weakest parts of *Chasing the Stick*, the lack of understanding the game in its whole context surrounding the online vitriol, the pairing with *Part I* and remastering the game for PS5. There is so much more wrapped up in this.

I'm thrilled that *The Last of Us Part II* has paved the way more deeper, richer looks at this game's development. I wonder how much of _The Last of Us Online_ we see, if any.
