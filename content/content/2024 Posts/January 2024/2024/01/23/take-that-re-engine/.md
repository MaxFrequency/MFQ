Thanks to a recent interview by [4Gamer](https://www.4gamer.net/games/716/G071602/20231225038/) (via [VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-ace-attorney-series-will-never-end-producer-says/)) with *Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy* producer Kenichi Hashimoto, I've learned that the impending release is powered by none other than the RE Engine.

I wrote about just how flexible Capcom's secret sauce is [[../../../../../../Archive/2022 Archive/2210/2022/10/25/re-engine-appreciation/|back in 2022]].

>Since *RE7*â€˜s release, Capcom has turned the Resident Evil engine into the Capcom Engine. There are currently a total of 17 games that use the RE Engine. The real dope part is how diverse that catalog of games is and how many different platforms are supported.
>
>While the bulk are third-person action/shooters, RE Engine also supports first-person games, VR, 2D platformers, retro-emulated arcade games, fighting games, action games, and online multiplayer games.

Add point-and-click style adventure games to the list now. 

In light of this news, I went back and checked the other two collections to see what engine they used. *Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy* uses Unity. This doesn't surprise me; as far as I can tell, the mobile ports were built off Unity back in 2013. 

*The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles*, which is on [[../../07/max-frequency-year-four/|my 2024 gaming goals list]], was brought in-house on the MT Framework engine, Capcom's old reliable before RE Engine.

When you look back, of course *Ace Attorney* would be brought onto the RE Engine at some point. It's clearly the foundation of Capcom's efforts for the foreseeable future. What I love about it, besides being more in awe of the tech, is that a series like *Ace Attorney* can stretch all the way up from the Game Boy Advance to modern hardware. I get this new trilogy is exclusively titles from the DS and 3DS, but I still love to see it. *Ace Attorney* has been on just about every platform you could imagine: Wii Ware, iOS, PC, PS4, Xbox, and a buttload of Nintendo hardware. Makes sense that such a flexible series would end up on such a flexible engine.
