[TUAW Returns as a Gross, Zombie AI-Generated Garbage Site](https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/07/tuaw-returns-as-a-gross-zombie-ai-generated-garbage-site/) by Jason Snell for Six Colors

> The tell? They’ve re-used the names of key historic contributors, but generated new bios and photos(!) and claim that new stories are written by these historic contributors. 
> 
> I looked up my friend Scott McNulty, a laughable 360-word “deep dive” that references Mac OS X Jaguar and Tiger. It’s dated July 1, 2024. The bio bears no resemblance to reality, and the dude in the photo is not Scott McNulty. The very least these crooks could’ve done is give Scott a hot author photo, but no.

Disgusting use of legacy work, staff, and content. It's worse than when a publication removes credits. This company is *making them up*. Seems they have since changed out real names for fake AI gobbledygook, but the lack of principle on display is apparent and abhorrent. 

Although, pun of the year goes to Jason Koebler of [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/a-beloved-tech-blog-tuaw-is-now-publishing-ai-articles-under-the-names-of-its-old-human-staff/) in their newsletter.

Hocked TUAW.

Immaculate work there. No AI could have generated that.
