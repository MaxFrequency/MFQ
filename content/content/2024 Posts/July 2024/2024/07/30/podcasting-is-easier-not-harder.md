The other day I read a little article from 9to5Mac titled "[Podcasting getting tougher as big names get most of the cash and audience](https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/29/podcasting-getting-tougher/)." 9to5Mac is doing their thing of tying other news—in this case, an [article from The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/a-few-blockbuster-podcasts-are-making-all-the-money-d9cee36e?st=mhq52z4prfgvooy)—into Apple here, but the core of it struck a nerve with me. Here's the opening of 9to5Mac's piece;

> Podcasting is getting tougher for those who don’t already have a significant following, says a new report, as a few big names take most of the cash and get most of the audience.

The nerve struck is "podcasting is getting tougher." Podcasting has never been easier. What this sentence and what The Wall Street Journal article are saying is *making money* podcasting is getting tougher. [[../../../../June 2024/2024/06/19/shutting-down-super-chapter-select|That's the truth]].

There is some stupid money being thrown into the podcasting ring, most notably from Spotify. But that doesn't make podcasting itself more difficult. Spotify's investments have made starting your own show absurdly simple. [[../../../../../Podcasts/BOPIIAC/But Our Princess is in Another Castle|Back in my day]], it took a lot of janky software to record a Skype call with two other teenagers. Today, anyone can start a show at the drop of a hat.

I talk about this very thing on [[../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/mfp-39|the next episode]] of [[../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/MFP|MFP]], which should be out tomorrow. If making money is your goal coming into podcasting, I wish you luck and godspeed. If you come into podcasting to make a show and share a passion, enjoy the tools at your fingertips. There's never been a better time to *make* a podcast.
