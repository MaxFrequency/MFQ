Last month, Super Chapter Select [[../../../../June 2024/2024/06/19/shutting-down-super-chapter-select|bit the dust]]. The silver lining in that decision was releasing all the member exclusive content for free.

> It's not all doom and gloom though. There is a big silver lining here for everyone! All that *Super* content is being released. I'll be working on migrating the *Super Editions* of episodes into the main feed along with the special bonus episodes we recorded. I will also be making all 23 videos publicly available. I'll get all my ducks in a row and then begin the process of scheduling it out, but it shouldn't take too long.

Over the last few weeks I have gotten my ducks in a row. Subscribers will have seen weekly drops of episodes dating back to the start of "Super Editions." Today marks the release of a never-before-heard episode in [[../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 4 - The Fast and the Furious/2023/09/27/chapter-select-s4e12/|2023/09/27/chapter-select-s4e12/]]. 

This was our bonus episode for [[../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 4 - The Fast and the Furious/chapterselect/season4/|chapterselect/season4/]]. We watched one of Justin Lin's first movies, which has a canonical tie with *The Fast and the Furious* franchise. It felt like the perfect complimentary episode and now it is available for all to hear. I am particularly proud of the art for this one. 

Next week will also be a couple never-before-heard episodes with the release of movie commentary tracks for *2 Fast 2 Furious* and *Fast Five*. Those are actually [already](https://youtu.be/zV7iNC65IXY) [up](https://youtu.be/ONsWhYeUw2A) on YouTube, but the audio versions will hit the feed over the next two weeks. 

The rest of these episodes will continue to role out weekly. The feed is already stacked through the end of the year. Most of these are just longer episodes with pre-show, off-topic discussions. We hope you enjoy them. As for new seasons, Logan and I are playing *Metroid Prime 2: Echoes* and continue to pave the way for [[../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 7 - Metroid Prime/chapterselect/season7/|chapterselect/season7/]].
