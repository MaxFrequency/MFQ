[202X: Video Game Reflections now available to pre-order! by Phil Summers](https://handdrawngameguides.gumroad.com)

> Video games can be much more than time wasters. They can lead to meaningful experiences in our lives, give us comfort in hard times, and create bonding moments with friends, family or even strangers. They can be a window inward, allowing us to understand ourselves and each other better.
> 
> From the creator of Hand-Drawn Game Guides comes 202X: Video Game Reflections. This book chronicles two years worth of gaming memories between the years 2022 and 2023. It contains insights, personal reflections and is full of original illustrations. It even has a bunch of handy tips and codes for each of the featured games.

Phil Summers is a friend and a wonderful artist. I've been captivated by his work from the moment I laid eyes on the original *The Legend of Zelda* [Hand-Drawn Game Guide](https://sites.google.com/view/handdrawngameguides/free-guides/the-legend-of-zelda-presented-by-hand-drawn-game-guides?authuser=0). Stoked to see his [Reflections series](https://sites.google.com/view/handdrawngameguides/game-reflections/game-reflections-2022?authuser=0) take physical form. We talked about his journey into the world of reflection and review back on [[../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2023/02/10/mfp-22/|MFP Episode 22, "The Fear of Nintendo Looms Over."]] 

Phil's work is always a treat that is saturated in detail, delight, and joy. I wholeheartedly recommend picking up a copy.
