Yesterday, I read this [shared post](https://512pixels.net/2024/06/oh-the-h-p-umanity/) from Stephen Hackett at 512Pixels about [[../../../../March 2024/2024/03/22/humanes-tries-to-tell-us-what-ai-pin-is-again/|Humane]] looking to sell to HP. I thought the notion of Humane selling to HP sounded familiar...

John Gruber, two weeks ago, in his piece [Humane is for Sale, but Who Would Buy Them](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale)?

> Off the top of my head, the only company that could afford a $1 billion-ish price for Humane and is dumb enough to do it is HP.

If this comes to pass, [give all the bragging rights](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/nyt-humane) to Gruber.
