[Aptoide becomes first non-Apple iOS store](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aptoide-becomes-first-non-apple-ios-store) by Sophie McEvoy for GamesIndustry.biz 

> "Independent app store Aptoide has launched on iOS in Europe after the Digital Markets Act was introduced earlier this year.
> 
> As reported by TechCrunch, the store launched last Thursday with six titles including Word Jungle, Condor â€“ A Leap of Faith, and Charades Guess the Word."

I guess AltStore PAL, which [launched two months ago](https://www.theverge.com/24100464/altstore-pal-dma-eu-launch-delta-nintendo-emulator-clip-clipboard-manager), doesn't count as the first? Setapp doesn't count [either](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/setapp-iphone-marketplace-may-14/)?
