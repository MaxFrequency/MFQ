Oh baby are we cooking now!

I've kept tabs on *Unbeatable* ever since I wrote about its Kickstarter *[[../../../../../Archive/2021 Archive/2104/2021/04/07/unbeatable-kickstarter-holy-smokes/|four years ago]]*. [^1] This "re-announcement" trailer is just as bonkers good as the first. The [art](https://www.unbeatablegame.com/assets/girl-Dh2CAoiT.png) and [style](https://www.unbeatablegame.com/assets/slider_2_s-R3U5eopw.jpg) still go just as hard as the pitch. I mean, [come on](https://player.vimeo.com/video/951727471?h=f98cbc79fc&background=1&autoplay=1&loop=1&frameborder=0&)! The final screen of the trailer reveals PS5 and Xbox versions are coming too. [[../../../../../Archive/2021 Archive/2104/2021/04/07/unbeatable-kickstarter-holy-smokes/|"please come to console someday"]] has turned into coming to console at launch. Sign me up for day one.

Here's the official description from the site;

> Unbeatable is a stunning hand-drawn anime inspired rhythm adventure game. Experience what it means to be a band on the run - music is illegal in this world, but you wonâ€™t let that stop you. Follow Beat & her bandmates through their journey of self discovery blending live song performances, spectacular set pieces and quirky rhythm mini games. Explore a detailed open world and engage in branching conversations with several unique characters. Featuring a 100% original soundtrack alongside guest tracks and musical collaborations.

And yes, I still cannot get over the tag line. It hits all the right notes in just 10 simple words.

> "A game where music is illegal and you do crimes."
