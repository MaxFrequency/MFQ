This is a two birds, one asteroid kind of post. Back when writing about [[../../../../April 2024/Mario meets Pareto - Antoine Mayerowitz|Mario Kart and statistics]], I dug into the author—Antoine Mayerowitz—and his other projects. His little project dubbed [Tiny Planets](https://supermayo.github.io/tinyPlanets/) spoke to me.

It's just a site that generates a random planet with a unique name and inhabitant. It's cute and quirky. I feel like I'd like to embed it on a site somewhere, but Antoine already does that. You can check out [the GitHub page](https://github.com/SuperMayo/tinyPlanets) too, if you like.

Then, during the surge of video game news last week, Toukana Interactive and kurzgesagt announced a little base builder, automation game called *[Star Birds](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3pk8aiXMQJU)*. You appear to inhabit a little *Super Mario Galaxy*-like asteroid where you build and automate little factories. It also is cute and quirky.

The two reminded me of each other, so here they are bunched up. I hope you take delight in them like I did.
