Last night I had the absolute pleasure of co-hosting the My Life in Gaming Sunday night stream with Try! I picked *Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus* since it just came to PS5, but Try played on good ol' original hardware. It was a blast to connect with their community and watch someone play one of my favorites for the first time. Give it a watch while you wait for [[../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/MFP|MFP]]'s new episode *with* Try all about the Nintendo Direct. ðŸ‘€
