The trip down memory lane continues as I archive my way through Max Frequency. Tonight, I came across [[../../../../../../Archive/2020 Archive/2008/2020/08/07/apple-rejects-cloud-gaming-xcloud/|this delicious gem]] when Apple first denied game streaming apps, like Game Pass/xCloud; instead wanting these companies to submit each game independently.

> This won’t last long. The bad press with the backdrop of the antitrust hearings will lead to a change in opinion rather quickly I’d imagine.

Now, in the year 2024, with the DMA in the EU, [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f1v8pyay#:~:text=Developers%20can%20now%20submit%20a,are%20found%20within%20their%20apps.) has [changed](https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/25/apple-game-streaming-app-store/) their mind on this almost four years later.

> Developers can now submit a single app with the capability to stream all of the games offered in their catalog.

One [bowl](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Claim%20Chowder) for me dear waiter!

But then, please let's not forget my guest, [Microsoft/Xbox](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations).

>Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass…We believe that the customer should be at the heart of the gaming experience and gamers tell us they want to play, connect and share anywhere, no matter where they are.

What does Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer [think](https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games) about Game Pass on iOS these days?

> There’s not room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS.

So much for believing the customer being the heart of the gaming experience.

Do you mind footing the bill for this meal Phil? I haven't had room to monetize my blog on the web.
