[Information ; Dear Friends and Partners](https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_2499.html)

> We are deeply saddened to inform you that Manga creator Akira Toriyama passed away on March 1st due to acute subdural hematoma. He was in age of 68.

My brother and I were obsessed with *Dragon Ball Z* was young boys. We soaked up the show. My brother collected most of the manga, back when manga was a few small shelves in a Barnes & Noble. I have those very books sitting behind me now. Some of my deepest, strongest, and warmest memories with my brother are intertwined with Goku and the rest of *DBZ*. 

My heart is heavy this morning as I found out the news. Toriyama has given the world so much. Thank you.
