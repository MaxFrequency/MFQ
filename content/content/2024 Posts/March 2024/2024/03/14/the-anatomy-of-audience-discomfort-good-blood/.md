[The Last of Us 2: The Anatomy of Audience Discomfort](https://youtube.com/watch?v=0vfgjBfsTTI) by Javed Sterritt for Good Blood and Second Wind

Always love a good Good Blood episode. Javed's editing style is *chef's kisses*. The intro alone had me enthralled. 

Even better than killer cuts is Javed's dive into the history of the "distancing effect" in theater. He goes right into the heart of *The Last of Us Part II*'s empathetic attempts by turning the house lights onto the player by putting it on the stick. 

His analysis resonated with me. Give it a watch.

On a related note, I love that Javed has [sources, credits, and a smidge of behind-the-scenes](https://goodblood.games/the-last-of-us-2-the-anatomy-of-audience-discomfort) out in public. This is the commitment to telling a story I love to see. Javed is no stranger to that [[../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2023/01/20/mfp-20/|love of research and desire for authenticity]].
