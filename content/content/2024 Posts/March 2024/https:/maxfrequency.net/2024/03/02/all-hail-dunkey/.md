I'm going back through all of Max Frequency and archiving my work. I come across [[../../../../../../../../Archive/2020 Archive/2005/2020/05/13/spoiler-alert-dunkey/|this post]] about a video Dunkey released in May 2020, right when *The Last of Us Part II* [[../../../../../../../../Archive/2020 Archive/2004/2020/04/27/the-last-of-us-part-ii-major-leaks-flowing/|leaks]] were spouting off. 

I decide to watch the video to remember why I shared it specifically and to have a good laugh.

Then the revelation hits me.

Somehow, I stayed away from the spoilers of *The Last of Us Part II*, despite being in the thick of it with [[../../../../../../../../chasing-the-stick/|Chasing the Stick]]. The layers to Dunkey's video here when you *know* everything that happens in the game, alongside the context of the leaks, makes this video even better.

All hail Dunkey and his deft humor.
