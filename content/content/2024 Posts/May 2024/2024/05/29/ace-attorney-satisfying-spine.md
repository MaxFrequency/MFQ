For my birthday, I ordered a few games from Play Asia and they showed up yesterday.

![[../../../../../../../docs/assets/img/Ace Attorney 123456 Face.jpg|Ace Attorney 123456 Face.jpg]]

I always wanted a physical copy of the *Ace Attorney Trilogy*, since it is a Japan exclusive. Now, the *Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy* does have a North American release, but I opted to get a matching set. Why?

Seriously, the 1·2·3·4·5·6 along the spines is [[../../../../../../../docs/assets/img/Ace Attorney 123456 Spines.jpg|so satisfying]]. If only [[../../../../../Archive/2023 Archive/2303/2023/03/24/the-true-horror-of-resident-evil/|another Capcom series]] could get their spines set straight.
