Sony has pulled down the entirety of [[../25/neil-druckmann-ai-next-game-quotes-context|Neil Druckmann's interview]] from their Creative Vision Presentation. Now the page has been [replaced](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html) with the following quote;

> [!quote]
> "In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview."

I am shocked someone at Sony would blatantly rewrite Neil's responses in such a flagrant way. I've update my original story to reflect this news. 

Even more baffling is that it took almost an entire week to correct this. It should have been done no later than when Neil called it out himself. It should have been caught before publication. Always have receipts, I suppose.

What a shame. I would not take anything quoted in the other interviews as truth now.
