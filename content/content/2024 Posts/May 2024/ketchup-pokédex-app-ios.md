[Ketchup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ketchup-for-pok%C3%A9mon/id6477297968) - Ben Rice McCarthy

> Ketchup is a beautifully designed Pokédex app that helps you quickly and easily find information about your favourite Pokémon, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and lots more.

Word about this app came my way from my pal Casey Liss. I'm a sucker for well designed apps that meet a nerdy video game need. Ben has made a slick Pokédex that makes your phone feel as powerful as the iconic device itself.

I've poked around Ketchup, but haven't bought it yet. I wish this was out during [[../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 6 - Pokémon/chapterselect/season6/|Chapter Select Season 6 - Pokémon]]. It would have been *perfect* to have alongside my quest to be the best. I could have filled out Ketchup in real time as I caught, trained, and built up my Pokémon teams. Perhaps I will Ponyta up the $9.99 when I go back to perform the great Pokémon Home Migration.

Ketchup does have this neat dial type match up section that is handy. I wish Ketchup had a team section though. I could imagine a section or way to categorize your teams from each game or generation, set moves and items, as well as see said type match ups with strengths and weaknesses. Since I was so competitive focused during the back half of my runs through the Pokémon games, I want more tools to help keep track of my competitive edge.

If you want to read and see more about Ketchup, MacStories has a good [review](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/ketchup-the-only-pokemon-companion-app-youll-ever-need/) from John Voorhees. There is also the [official page](https://benricemccarthy.com/ketchup/) from Ben. Also, don't let the App Store screenshots fool you; the app features real photos and sprites of the Pokémon. The App Store page just has silhouettes for legal reasons.

Ketchup is the Pokédex app we've all been waiting for.
