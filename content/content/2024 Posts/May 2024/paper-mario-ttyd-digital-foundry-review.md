[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door - DF Switch Review - Brilliant Visuals... At 30FPS](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fVWINNRvfB4) by Tom Morgan for Digital Foundry

You know this was the review I was waiting for. It was also my first in-depth look at the environments of the game. And hooooo baby this remake looks stunning. One of those, this is how it always looked in my mind's eye sort of remakes. It reminds me of *The Last of Us Part I* for PS5; a total visual overall for a classic to bring it up to modern standards of the series and hardware.

The side-by-side shots in particular are astounding and really showcase what difference 20 years makes. ðŸ¥µ I am not worried about the 30FPS given the fact it is apparently rock solid. Sure, 60 FPS would have been ideal, but stable framerate is key. 

With all the other [[../April 2024/insert-drool-emoji-over-paper-mario-ttyd-aesthetic|changes]], I am oh so eager to see it in action on my own TV through the RetroTINK-4K [[../../../../docs/assets/img/PaperMarioTTYD Switch Box Launch.jpg|later today]].[^1] ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥
