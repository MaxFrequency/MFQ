I'm trying a new idea out. I've always taken notes while I play games. From a tiny notebook with the patterns of Master and Crazy Hand to beat [Event 50](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Event_50:_Final_Destination_Match) in *Super Smash Bros. Melee* to show notes for [[../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|chapterselect/]], I am always writing down my thoughts and observations.

Over the course of this year, I've been exposed to [Mike Schmitz](https://mikeschmitz.com/about/) and have partaken in a couple of his cohorts. One neat thing that Mike does is take book notes in [Mindnode](https://www.mindnode.com). Once he finishes, he shares those notes within his community, at the end of a newsletter, or in the show notes for [Bookworm](https://bookworm.fm). I took this idea of using Mindnode and applied it to my video game notes. 

I just beat *The Great Ace Attorney 2 Resolve* and its the first game I've beaten using this format of note taking. I liked it. And so I figured I'd share my notes too. Here they are:

[[../../Game Notes/The Great Ace Attorney 2 Resolve Notes|The Great Ace Attorney 2 Resolve Notes]]

These aren't traditional reviews. They are just my knee jerk reactions in real time to the game that I played. There's something appealing about seeing the mind map laid out. Being able to spit out the maps as Markdown also makes turning them into traditional notes all the easier. 

I have an idea as to where these notes can graph themselves to in the future, but there's no reason to not share them now, as is. The only ones I expect I'll hold back are the ones for games related to [[../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|chapterselect/]], until those episodes air. Other than that, I'll publish as I beat the games. This should be fun! I hope you enjoy.
