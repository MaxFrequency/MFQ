A few months before the launch of The Last Of Us, Naughty Dog announced that the game would be getting DLC, both single player and multiplayer. As the norm, a season pass was announced alongside for a mere $19.99. Included with the season pass was Day 1 DLC, which included-

Day 1 Bonuses

- Increased Crafting Speed
- Increased Healing Speed
- 9mm Reload Speed Upgrade
- Rifle Clip Capacity Upgrade
- Grounded – exclusive 90min “Making of The Last of Us” documentary

That last item, the documentary, was something I totally spaced about by the time launch came around. I stumbled across a Twitter post mentioning the documentary, so I googled and was reminded that the film was included with my purchase. I logged onto PSN in hopes of finding it in my purchases, but to no avail. I searched all over, both the store and the internet, but could not find the documentary. Finally I asked the Podcast Beyond Facebook group and they came to my aid. I decided to take this opportunity and make a video showing you how to download the Grounded: Making of The Last Of Us documentary. Not only will this video help you, but it has helped me with video editing and becoming comfortable with my “radio” voice. One step closer to providing you with better content! Thank you for watching and enjoy!
