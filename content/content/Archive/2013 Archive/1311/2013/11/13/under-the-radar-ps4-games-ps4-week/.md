*It truly is an exciting time to be a gamer. The next generation of console gaming is upon us. Hundreds of games are being made for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. With the launch of the PS4 just one day away, I invited [Mitchell Morgan](https://twitter.com/mdawg2438) to write a piece for Go Left Gaming’s PS4 Launch Week. Mitchell decided to about the games you need to keep on your radar, despite the lack of news and being over shadowed by huge first-party launch titles. So without further ado, here are games you need to keep an eye on.*

# BlackLight: Retribution

“Free-to-play” is often thought of in a negative light, and for good reason. Most free-to-play games feel like unfinished products that you must heavily invest in to achieve any sort of satisfaction. Blacklight : Retribution, a free-to-play shooter, is one of the few gems within the genre.

Blacklight will be familiar to anyone who has played an online first person shooter. It’s split into several different game modes, ranging from “Team Death Match” to “Kill Confirmed”, but that is where the similarities stop. Before you jump into a round, you’ll be asked to customize your load out. Customizing doesn’t just mean picking out a gun though; you’re going to build your weapon. You choose everything from the type of gun (Light Machine Gun, for example), to the muzzle and the stock on that weapon. Each element combines to form your own personalized gun.

When you jump into Blacklight, you’ll be introduced to a little device called HRV, or a Hyper Reality Visor. The HRV allows the player to see the entire map, enemies included. No more wandering around the map, looking for someone to shoot. Just press one button and the entire map will reveal itself to you.

It’s difficult to capture what makes Blacklight so great by writing about it. I’ve sunk nearly one hundred hours in it on PC, yet it’s still hard to describe that great, satisfying feeling you get when you play it. It’s an adrenaline packed game that you can’t miss.

# Binding of Isaac

When The Binding of Isaac hit on PC, no one knew what to think of it. A religious based, top down rogue-like made by one of the creators of Super Meat Boy? Not exactly the best sell, but it ended up being one of the best games of 2011. In 2014, The Binding of Isaac is coming back in the form of “Rebirth”, a remake of the original release.

You play as Isaac, a young boy trying to escape from his crazed mother. Along the way, Isaac will come across certain power-ups that enhance his abilities. This is where the fun begins. You see, no two playthroughs of The Binding of Isaac will ever be the same. One game you could find items that make you an invincible god, and the next, you won’t find anything. It’s the luck of the draw with The Binding of Isaac, and that’s what makes it most intriguing.

The Rebirth edition of Isaac will feature a new art style, two new characters (on top of the 5 that you can already choose from), and two player couch co-op. Rebirth will include all of the content from the original Isaac, as well as plenty of new items, rooms, and levels to explore. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth will be released on PS4 and PS Vita in early 2014, and will be free for PS+ members.

# Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

We know very little about this game. But what we do know makes it one of PS4’s most enticing titles. Developed by The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture puts you into the shoes of six different characters exploring the world after the Rapture. And that is literally all we know. Is it going to be any good? Who knows. But the Chinese Room’s pedigree alone make this a game worth keeping your eye on.
