Panda Global announced an incoming Kickstarter project for a portable Switch dock that includes four GameCube controller ports for playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the go. Dubbed the "Panda Global's Ultimate GameCube Adapter," this will make playing Ultimate on the go with a GameCube controller far less convoluted. The Kickstarter will launch in early/mid January. The adapter will cost roughly $45 USD and will ship internationally. Panda Global tweeted out a teaser video that shows the adapter working with a Switch in handheld mode. The team followed up with a few answers to some frequently asked questions. The questions and their answers are below.

By "will it brick," Panda Global means that this adapter will not double as a dock to output the Switch to a TV since third-party docks have a tendency to break (also known as brick) Switch consoles. There will possibly be an ethernet port on the back to provide LAN support for online play.

If you are interested in the Kickstarter and want to be alerted when it goes live in January 2019, you may sign up for email alerts that will include a discount for the Kickstarter.

Another option for using GameCube controllers with a Switch, outside of Nintendo's official adapter, you may buy [[../1811/8BitDo Announces a Wireless GameCube Adapter for Nintendo Switch|8BitDo's wireless GameCube controller adapter]], but it only supports one GameCube controller.
