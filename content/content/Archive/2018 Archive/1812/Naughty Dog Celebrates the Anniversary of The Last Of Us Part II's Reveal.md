To commemorate the initial reveal of The Last Of Us Part II, Naughty Dog has published a video filled with reactions to the original trailer. More than 30 clips from reactions play over the reveal at PSX 2016. You can watch the reaction down below.

The anniversary video goes through the entire reveal at PSX 2016 with the reactions playing alongside it. Fans cry, cheer, clap, and scream their way through the near five-minute reveal trailer showing off Ellie singing and threatening to kill a whole bunch of people. At PSX 2016 during a panel, Neil Druckmann said that the sequel would be a story about vengeance.

Reactions from over 30 videos are pulled together in this compilation. It's either an effect that'll pull you into the hype of that moment or make you chuckle at how hyped Naughty Dog fans can get. Little did those fans know that the game would still be quite a ways off 2-years later.

Since its announcement, The Last Of Us Part II has gotten two more trailers and one gameplay demo. The second trailer debuted at Paris Games Week 2017 and featured entirely new characters (plus a super gruesome torture scene). At E3 2018, Naughty Dog showed the world a new scene that melded into the first look at the [highly anticipated](https://www.dualshockers.com/zelda-goty-game-awards/) sequel's [gameplay](https://www.dualshockers.com/last-us-part-ii-reveal-e3-2018/).

Naughty Dog has been relatively quiet about the game since E3 2018, only piping up around the in-game anniversary of [Outbreak Day with Mondo Tees to sell new merchandise from the franchise](https://www.dualshockers.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-outbreak-day-ellie-t-shirt-vinyl-record-poster-and-more/). This celebration does not indicate any sort of new reveal happening anytime soon, despite The Game Awards airing this Thursday, December 6.
