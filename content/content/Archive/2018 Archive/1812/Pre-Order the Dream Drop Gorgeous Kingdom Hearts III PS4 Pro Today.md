Pre-orders for the Kingdom Hearts III custom PS4 Pro are live today exclusively at GameStop according to the PlayStation Blog. [Originally revealed at E3 2018](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-iii-gets-new-trailer-revealing-pirates-caribbean-limited-edition-ps4/), this exclusive PS4 Pro comes bundled with a physical copy of Kingdom Hearts III, a special controller, and a 1TB hard drive. It will cost $399.99 USD and $499.99 CAD in Canada.

The PS4 Pro is detailed with an intricate drawing combining many signature elements of the Kingdom Hearts franchise, such as Keyblades, hearts, and crowns. There is a special Kingdom Hearts logo in the corner as well. The controller also has detailing on the touchpad and a crown above the D-Pad and a heart below the D-Pad. You can check it out in the gallery below.

The bundle will also include PlayStation exclusive digital content. There is a "Kingdom Hearts III Limited Edition Original Theme" as well as the Midnight Blue Keyblade, which looks similar to the Star Seeker Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts II.

Japan is also getting this exclusive PS4 Pro, but it isn't their only special edition PS4. [Announced last month, Japan is also getting a special Kingdom Hearts III edition PS4 Slim](https://www.dualshockers.com/japan-exclusive-kingdom-hearts-iii-ps4-new-images/). It features the more [traditional checkerboard design of previous Kingdom Hearts collector's editions](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Hj7GV4kyL._AC_SL1500_.jpg), with symbols from the series. The same Kingdom Hearts logo on the PS4 Pro is featured in the upper middle of this system. This system will also come with an exclusive theme for the PS4 cross-media bar.
