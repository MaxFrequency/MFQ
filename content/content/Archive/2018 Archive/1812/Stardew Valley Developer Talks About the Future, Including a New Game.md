Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has published a new blog post on the Stardew Valley Developer Blog detailing what he is currently working on for Stardew Valley and his next game. This blog post comes just two days after the 1.3 update came to the Nintendo Switch version, [[./Stardew Valley for Switch is Finally Getting Multiplayer Support this Week|which included multiplayer and new single-player content]]. Barone opens up with a reminder that he is now self-publishing nearly all versions of Stardew Valley. [He made this announcement on November 30 in a blog post as well](https://www.dualshockers.com/stardew-valley-concernedape-self-publishing-chucklefish/). Barone is now directly responsible for publishing the PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PS4, and PS Vita versions of the game. Chucklefish still handles publishing for the Switch and mobile versions of the game.When talking about his next project, Barone still keeps his lips sealed. He doesn't want to reveal the game until its concept is fully realized and to relieve himself of working under pressure. He did remind folks that the new game will take place in the same universe as Stardew Valley though.As for the future of Stardew Valley, it looks a little brighter for fans. French, Korean, Italian, and Turkish translations are currently in development. Barone also states that he doesn't want to finish the game quite yet.

> "...I always find myself coming back to Stardew Valley. For one, I keep getting new ideas for ways to improve and expand upon the game. This world is so full of potential, I could probably work on it for the rest of my life. There's also such a wonderful community surrounding the game and I like making you guys happy. I'm extremely grateful to all of you for supporting my work and creating this wonderful Stardew Valley community."

He has currently put his new, untitled game on hold to work on a 1.4 update for Stardew Valley. While fixing bugs and issues in the current builds (1.3 is not available on all platforms as of this writing) of the game is Barone's number one priority, development on update 1.4 has begun.

To keep the world and game of Stardew Valley ongoing for the foreseeable future, Barone is creating a team to help continue making new single-player content after update 1.4. This will allow him to divide his time between Stardew Valley and his next game.
