Back your bags for Tokyo, Japan because the Disney Ambassador Hotel at Tokyo Disneyland is making over rooms to be more Kingdom Hearts themed for March 2019. Reservations open up on January 31, 2019 and the rooms will include special Keyblade access keys, special postcards, and decorations.

Rooms will start at Â¥46,100~ ($423~) and will have room for three adults. There will be two regular beds and one trundle bed. The covers look to have the Kingdom Hearts iconography all over them, similar to the [PS4 Slim Limited Edition system exclusively in Japan](https://www.dualshockers.com/japan-exclusive-kingdom-hearts-iii-ps4-new-images/). The headboards, fittingly, have art from the 3DS game, Dream Drop Distance.

Art from the franchise will adorn the walls of the room. More Kingdom Hearts themed furniture like a table will also be placed around the room. There will also be a special menu, but won't be revealed until a later date.

To enter the rooms, guests will have a special Keyblade access key. Two will be given out per room and they come in a special edition box. The Keyblade is designed after Sora's original Keyblade. Guests will also receive four special postcards for staying in the room.

The special Kingdom Hearts themed rooms are not a permanent addition to the hotel though. The rooms will only be around through June 23, 2019. Check out the gallery below of what the hotel rooms, Keyblade room keys, and postcards will look like.

Kingdom Hearts III itself will be out in just 13 days as of this writing. It will be released for PS4 and Xbox One on January 29. The game's [[./Kingdom Hearts III Secret Ending and More have to be Downloaded Days After Release UPDATE|epilogue and secret ending will be patched in after launch]], but that hasn't stopped the [game's trophies](https://www.dualshockers.com/kingdom-hearts-3-ps4-trophies/) and [opening song](https://www.dualshockers.com/face-my-fears-full-leak/) from leaking into the wild.
