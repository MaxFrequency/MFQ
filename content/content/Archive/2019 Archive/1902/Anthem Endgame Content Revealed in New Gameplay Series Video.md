EA and Bioware have released part two of their gameplay series focused on Anthem. Aptly titled "This Is Anthem," the series has focused on, you guessed it, revealing the gameplay all you freelancers will be partaking in later this month. Part two shows off the endgame content for Anthem that will hopefully keep players coming back for more and more. You may watch the video below.

Anthem's Game Director Jonathan Warner narrates the 5:30 minute video, guiding viewers through the various activities that will keep you employed as a freelancer. Most of the focus is laid on customizing you Javalin to your heart's desire will in the constant pursuit of better, stronger, rarer loot.

Anthem will feature six levels of difficulty, three of which unlock only in the post game. You've got your standard easy, normal, and hard modes. The last three are called Grandmaster 1, 2, and 3. Certainly makes you sound like an all-powerful warrior when you call a difficulty that. These will be unlocked once you hit level 30, which should be when you beat the game.

The video discusses five different endgame activities for players to engage in--Challenges, contracts, freeplay, strongholds, and cataclysms. Challenges occur on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis and reward you with materials and coin. Use all those materials on blueprints earned from completing contracts.

Strongholds will offer some of the more difficult challenges in Anthem's post game. They require a team to complete and sure do remind me a lot of raids in Destiny when laid out on paper. The video shows a team of three exploring a wide space and fighting a big, spooky monster. [We actually had the opportunity to try out a stronghold, which you can check out here](https://www.dualshockers.com/anthem-late-game-stronghold-gameplay/).

Cataclysms will be "world altering," limited time events that will provide the most ambitious and challenging tasks in the game. It's unclear if they will be announced beforehand or be more random in nature.

Anthem sounds like it has a lot going for it for its endgame content. T[he game's demo recently wrapped up with over 40 million hours of combined playtime](https://www.dualshockers.com/anthem-demo-exceeded-bioware-ea-expectations-improvements-full-game/). [EA is expecting Anthem to sell between 5 and 6 million copies](https://www.dualshockers.com/anthem-ea-sales-expectations-fiscal-year/) in just one month after launch. We shall see if this kind of endgame content is enough to keep those players around. Anthem will [launch for everyone](https://www.dualshockers.com/anthem-release-schedule-reaction/) on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on February 22.
