Nintendo has announced that Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is getting two new DLC packs for Nintendo Switch. The first will be free and add co-op to the entire game. The next DLC will be a paid expansion that will add new challenges and courses. The paid DLC will be out on March 14, while the co-op DLC will be released today.

The entire game will support two player co-op now. The second player will be Blue Toad and can do everything that the OG Captain Toad can do. It will be interesting to see how co-op will affect the puzzle nature of each level.

Some of the worlds are clearly inspired by Super Mario Odyssey. 18 new challenges will be added with five new courses. A price was not announced during the Nintendo Direct, but fans that pre-order the DLC today will get access to one of the new courses today.

Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was originally released for the Wii U in 2014. It was inspired by a mini-game in Super Mario 3D World. The puzzle adventure was ported to the Switch in July 2018. [In our review of the Switch port](https://www.dualshockers.com/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-review/), we praised the game for its puzzle design and new additions.
