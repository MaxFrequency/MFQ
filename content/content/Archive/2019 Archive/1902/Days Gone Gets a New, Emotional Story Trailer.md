PlayStation has released a new story trailer for Bend Studio's open-world game Days Gone. The trailer shows Deacon St. John revisiting the church where he married Sarah Whitaker and having flashbacks to their wedding day. The reminiscing is cut short when a gang of enemies follows Deacon to the church and ambushes him. You may watch the trailer below.

The trailer bounces between the past and the present, with Deacon in the church remains. The enemies ride up on motorcycles too, clearly hunting for Deacon. Deacon doesn't seem to have any problem escaping the men inside and clearing out the ones outside the church, going so far as to use a sledgehammer on one of them.

There is a song playing throughout the entire trailer too. It's a new release by Billy Raffoul titled "Hell or High Water." The song appears to be recorded for Days Gone itself: The album art features Deacon in a black and white silhouette with the words "Featured in Days Gone" near the bottom. You can listen to the song below.

Leading up to this trailer's reveal, Bend Studio shared [plenty of new screenshots of Deacon and Sarah](https://www.dualshockers.com/days-gone-new-screenshots-deacon-and-sarah/). They even sent out faux wedding invitations to help promote the trailer today; both via the mail and promotional emails.

Days Gone has been receiving plenty of new trailers lately. A series of videos was released showcasing the world of Days Gone and just what players will be doing in this tattered, post-apocalyptic world. [[../1901/Days Gone is all About Your Motorcycle in This New Video|One video walked through your in-game motorcycle and world activities]]. Another was [[./Days Gone Shows Off Freaker Enemy Types in a New World Video|all about the zombie-like Freakers]] that are the main threat in the world.

Days Gone kicked off this cycle of reveals last January when [Bend Studio and PlayStation revealed the game's collector's edition and pre-order bonuses](https://www.dualshockers.com/days-gone-collectors-edition-pre-order-bonuses/). We recently had some hands-on time with the game too! Our own Grant Huff got to play a demo at PAX South last month. [You can read his thoughts on the game here](https://www.dualshockers.com/pax-south-2019-day-1-recap/).

Days Gone will be out exclusively for PS4 on April 26. You may pre-order the game on Amazon here, if you'd like to lock in your copy now and help DualShockers a little too.
