Guacamelee! and Guacamelee! 2 are getting the physical game treatment thanks to Leadman Games. The Guacamelee! One-Two Punch Collection will be released for both Nintendo Switch and PS4 this May for $39.99 and plenty of physical goodies. A short trailer was released for the collection, which you can watch below.

The collection comes not only with a physical copy of the games, but also a full manual, a double-sided poster, and downloadable copies of each game's soundtrack. With Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition costing $14.99 and Guacamelee! 2 costing $19.99, fans will be paying a difference of $5.01 for all these physical extras.

Leadman Games is a newer publisher on the scene. They only have one other physical release, which is Salt and Sanctuary: Drowned Tome Edition for the Switch. What's nifty about Leadman Games (besides making physical copies), is that their games are available at a variety of retailers, including Amazon, Target, and GameStop.

Guacamelee 2! [[../../2018 Archive/1811/Guacamelee! 2 on Switch Arrives in Early December, Xbox One in January|recently launched on both Xbox One]] and [[../../2018 Archive/1812/2018/12/10/guacamelee-2-feels-like-a-natural-fit-on-nintendo-switch/|Switch, the latter feeling like a natural fit for the game]]. In [our review of Guacamelee 2!](https://www.dualshockers.com/guacamelee-2-review-ps4-pc/), we said the sequel was "...a finely crafted Metroidvania that iterates and improves upon everything that already made the original so great." The Guacamelee series made its debut on [Nintendo's hybrid system last year](https://www.dualshockers.com/guacamelee-switch-release/).

Guacamalee! One-Two Punch Collection with be available for Switch and PS4 on May 28 for $39.99 and you may pre-order your copy today.
