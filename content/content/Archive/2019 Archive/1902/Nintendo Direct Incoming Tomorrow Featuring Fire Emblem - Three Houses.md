The long silence has ended and a new Nintendo Direct is coming in hot. Nintendo has announced that the next Nintendo Direct will happen tomorrow, February 13, at 5:00 PM EST/2:00 PM PST. The Direct will be roughly 35 minutes long and will focus on Nintendo Switch games. Fire Emblem: Three Houses was specifically mentioned and will have new details revealed during the Direct.

Not much has been revealed about the latest Fire Emblem game. [The last time Nintendo shared anything about the game was at E3 2018](https://www.dualshockers.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-screenshots/), where the game was delayed into Spring 2019. This will be the first home console Fire Emblem game since the Wii era with Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn in 2007. We could possibly see a release date for Fire Emblem: Three Houses during the Nintendo Direct.

Other possible Switch titles that could appear in the Nintendo Direct tomorrow are Luigi's Mansion 3, Yoshi's Crafted World, or the all-new Pok√©mon game. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate may get more DLC news, [possibly a gameplay reveal for Joker](https://www.dualshockers.com/super-smash-bros-ultimate-persona-5-joker-dlc-character/). [[../1901/Metroid Prime 4 is Rebooting Development, Retro Studios in Charge|Metroid Prime 4 will most likely not be mentioned in any capacity following the recent announcement that the game is starting development over entirely]].

The Nintendo 3DS is not mentioned at all in the promotional material. Depending on the 3DS' appearance in tomorrow's Nintendo Direct, it could be indicative of the system's future in 2019. Both [Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story](https://www.dualshockers.com/mario-luigi-bowsers-inside-story-release-date/) and Yokai Watch 3 were just released for the system, with no major titles from Nintendo in sight. We just reviewed Yokai Watch 3, [which you can read here](https://www.dualshockers.com/yokai-watch-3-review/).

You can watch the Nintendo Direct in the video link below tomorrow when Nintendo flips the switch and makes it live. It should be an exciting time for Nintendo fans and Switch owners as Nintendo shows the beginning of their 2019 plans in earnest.
