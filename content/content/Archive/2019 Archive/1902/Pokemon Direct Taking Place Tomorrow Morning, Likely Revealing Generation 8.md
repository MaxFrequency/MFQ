Nintendo and the Pokemon Company have announced that a new Pokemon Direct will happen tomorrow at 9:00 AM EST / 6:00 AM PST. It will last seven minutes and will contain "new information," presumably on the brand new Pokemon Generation VIII game for Switch.

[The official Pokemon Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1100395765795500032) sheds a tiny bit more light on the impending direct by saying "Set your alarms, Trainersâ€”you donâ€™t want to miss this PokÃ©mon Day!" Tomorrow is Pokemon Day, which celebrates the launch of the Pokemon series in Japan with activitiesÂ around the world. This tease leans into the likelihood that Generation 8 may be revealed tomorrow.

The new core Pokemon game [was confirmed for](https://www.dualshockers.com/core-pokemon-game-confirmed-switch-nintendos-e3-spotlight-event/) Switch back [at E3 2017](https://www.dualshockers.com/core-pokemon-game-confirmed-switch-nintendos-e3-spotlight-event/), hot off the heels of the Switch's launch. [Developing for the Switch may have been tougher for the Pokemon Company than expected](https://www.dualshockers.com/pokemon-ceo-developing-switch/), but that hasn't stopped multiple Pokemon games coming to the Switch. _Pokken Tournament DX_ was a port of the Wii U fighting game. [_Pokemon Quest_ is a free-to-play game](https://www.dualshockers.com/pokemon-quest-new-free-play-title-available-nintendo-switch-right-now/), while the more traditional-inspired remake of Pokemon Yellow came out last year as _Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu_ and _Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee_. We were "thoroughly surprised" with last year's remakes, which you can [read about in our review](https://www.dualshockers.com/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-review-switch/).

Having the new generation of Pokemon come to the Switch will be the first time ever that a mainline, core Pokemon game has launched on a Nintendo home console. Thanks to the portable nature of the Switch, fans can still take the game on the go, trade, and battle wherever they'd like to. In the past, to play a core Pokemon game on the big screen, fans would have to use Nintendo's Game Boy adapters for home consoles.

You can watch the Pokemon Direct right here tomorrow morning. Stay tuned for all the news we can extract out of those precious seven minutes. Tomorrow may be one of the beloved series biggest yet.
