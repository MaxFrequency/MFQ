Yacht Club Games (Yacht Club from here on out) has announced via their blog that the final wave of _Shovel Knight_ content has been delayed. The final two expansions, Amiibo, and the physical bundles for Switch and PS4 have been delayed for "several months– at most," according to Yacht Club's blog post.

The reason for the delay is polish and multi-team coordination, since launching these four products simultaneously is still Yacht Club's priority. They want to have all the content on disc/cartridge for the physical releases and have these two full-fledged game expansions polished to their high standards for _Shovel Knight_. When addressing the initial disappointment fans may feel (I know I did), Yacht Club said [this in their post](https://yachtclubgames.com/2019/02/last-stop-before-treasure-trove/),

> "We realize the delay is disappointing. To communicate better with everyone moving forward, we will not be announcing a new date until we know one for sure, from all partners involved. All builds shipped out, updates ready to launch, for everybody and everyone. We will announce it for good once it is 100% all across the board!"

There is hope to be found in the delay though. The team promised updates more frequently since the delay is not major and teased impending trailers. With PAX East coming up, it's not hard to imagine more being shown off [where _Shovel Knight_ was back in 2013](https://goleftgaming.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/episode-03-an-interview-with-yacht-club-games/). More insight was also shared for each element in progress, giving a glimpse behind this final stretch of development.

_Shovel Knight: King of Cards_ will have over 30 levels, but are much shorter than previous levels in the series. Yacht Club is putting a huge emphasis on polishing these levels. Shovel Knight Showdown is getting its own Story Mode, plus all the stages, characters, and AI had to be created and balanced.

Yacht Club has also been making sure King Knight's campaign will fit on the 3DS, as to not leave this final campaign out of one of the game's original platforms. Localization for nine languages is also being done, plus testing every game and expansion on 10 different platforms for bugs. Yacht Club says they will not announce a date until they have a date locked in for future projects too.

_Shovel Knight: King of Cards_ and _Shovel Knight Showdown_ are the final two expansions and were set to be released simultaneously on April 9, alongside the Amiibo triple pack and the [physical edition of _Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove_](https://www.dualshockers.com/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-physical-release/). This will also delay [[../../2018 Archive/1811/Shovel Knight's Third Soundtrack for Specter of Torment Finally Making its Vinyl Debut|the fourth and final vinyl soundtrack release]]. _King of Cards_ allows players to play as King Knight through an entirely new campaign with new levels, while [Showdown is a Smash Bros. style brawler with all sorts of characters from the game](https://www.dualshockers.com/shovel-knight-showdown-announcement/). You can check out new screenshots for both games in the gallery below.
