[Hermen Hulst Q&A: Interview with Head of PlayStation’s Worldwide Studios – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/03/10/hermen-hulst-qa-interview-with-head-of-playstations-worldwide-studios/)

>PSB: Speaking of experimentation, there have been rumors of a Horizon Zero Dawn complete edition that might be coming to PC… can you confirm or deny that?
HH: Yes, I can confirm that Horizon Zero Dawn is coming to PC this summer…. There will be more information coming from Guerrilla, from the new studio directors (Michiel van der Leeuw, JB van Beek, and Angie Smets) pretty soon.

Last one from the [[../../17/the-backlog-of-news/|backlog of news]] I mentioned last week. Had a reason for getting it out today.

It strikes me as funny that The PlayStation Blog is “asking” a question like this. The blog is a total promotional platform for PlayStation, obviously. Seems like a roundabout way to announce a major port, but Sony has been playing 2020 at the beat of their own 100+ million strong drum.

The bigger and more exciting news is that the [[../../../../../2001/2020/01/28/playstation-game-engines-decima-bubblebath/|Decima engine gets to spread its PC wings twice this summer]]. Very exciting times for Sony Worldwide Studios.
