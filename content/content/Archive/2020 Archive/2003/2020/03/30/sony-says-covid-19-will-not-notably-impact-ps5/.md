[Sony Says Virus Disruptions May Hit Profit, Delay Reporting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/sony-says-virus-may-wipe-out-forecast-upgrade-delay-earnings) by Takashi Mochizuki for Bloomberg

>A Sony spokeswoman said it doesnâ€™t see any notable impact on the launch of its next-generation game console PlayStation 5 planned at the end of this year.

Encouraging to hear, in light of everything going on. As my buddy Logan pointed out to me when we were chatting about this statement, of course Sony would say this now. While the release of this console (and the Xbox Series X) are still a ways off, the production of these systems should start soon. We shall see just how difficult the PS5 is to come by when Holiday 2020 rolls around.
