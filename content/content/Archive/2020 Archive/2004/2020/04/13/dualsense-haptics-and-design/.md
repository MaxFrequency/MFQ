> I’ve gotten to try the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers on this thing and was very impressed. I think games are gonna do some really cool things with them.

[Pete Hines tweeted out](https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1248003450585022464) his take after hands on time with the DualSense via David Gill for [DualShockers](https://www.dualshockers.com/pete-hines-dualsense-playstation-5/). 

Haptics are certainly the most exciting component of the DualSense. [[../../07/ps5-dualsense-revealed/|Like I said]] when the controller was revealed, rumble is well past due for its refinement. It’s encouraging to hear at least one positive interaction. The rest of us will have to wait until later this year. Hopefully the press can get some hands on time this summer. 

I’d also like to say that I’ve come around on the look of the controller. Looking at it longer, I like the color scheme. It reminds me of my [Death Stranding PS4 Pro](https://media.playstation.com/is/image/SCEA/limited-edition-death-stranding-ps4-pro-product-shot-04-ps4-us-17sep19?$native_xxl_nt$). The color scheme also leads me to believe that the PS5 will probably be predominantly white. It has been eight years since we’ve had any home console launch with a white variant; 14 years since one solely with white as the choice. PlayStation has never launched with a white console. We will have to wait and see what Sony decides to do.
