Dang it. I thought Netflix and Disney+ would be enough. Then they had to go and put out new Looney Toons cartoons on HBO Max.

They actually premiered [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK541L5x_IY) of the cartoons last year. They look incredibly zany, goofy, and looney; just like the originals. I am so down for new Looney Toons.
