It has been a flurry of news today for The Last of Us Part II. Naughty Dog has come out and made a statement in regards to [[../the-last-of-us-part-ii-major-leaks-flowing/|the leaks that occurred this weekend]]. I’ve copied tweets below since the replies are no doubt filled with spoilers.

> We know the last few days have been incredibly difficult for you. We feel the same. It’s disappointing to see the release and sharing of pre-release footage from development. Do your best to avoid spoilers and we ask that you don’t spoil it for others.
>
> The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands soon. No matter what you see and hear, the final experience will be worth it.

Neil Druckmann also shared a brief tweet of disappointment.

> Heartbroken for the team. Heartbroken for our fans. We’re still incredibly excited to get the game into your hands.

~~As the day has gone on, it sounds like the leak came from a disgruntled employee. Rumors seem to claim it was sparked over a payment issue. This makes sense with the multiplayer code leaking, [[../the-last-of-us-part-ii-major-leaks-flowing/|as I mentioned this morning]].~~

How sad. How ultimately petty. All this accomplished was hurting former co-workers, friends, developers, and fans. While not flushing seven years of work down the drain, to be so close to the [[../the-last-of-us-part-ii-release-date-set/|release]] certainly hurts. I think Jason Schreier puts it best in these [two](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1254832952057434113) [tweets](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1254845187941072898) (please click the links at your own risk).

> Just catching up on this Naughty Dog story and man, no matter how angry you are about your workplace conditions or your pay or whatever else, leaking your whole game just hurts all the other people who were in the trenches with you. So many better ways to channel that rage.
>
> It’s amazing how many people responding to this don’t seem to get that devs at Naughty Dog (including a couple I just talked to) can be both infuriated by crunch culture AND devastated that their hard work just leaked. This action doesn’t just hurt management — it hurts workers.

Update: [Sony has told GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-27-the-last-of-us-part-2-leaked-online) that the leak did not come from inside of Sony or Naughty Dog. While the source was not revealed, due to an ongoing investigation, it is nice to know that no one internal caused the leak.

> Sony has confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz that it has identified the primary individuals responsible for the leaks earlier this week, saying they were not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment or Naughty Dog, as was rumored.

It seems that these were just rumors about a disgruntled employee, I do stand by my sentiment toward that kind of leak anyway. I’ve crossed out the text that indicates an employee was the source though.

To close it down the same way I originally did, here is a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1255977949175693312) from Jason. I’ve copied it below because those replies just have to be spoiler filled.

> I do regret tweeting a Take on this earlier when we didn’t actually know whether it was a ND employee (serves me right for reacting to Twitter) but some of the claims don’t add up. ND has real issues (ones I’ve covered a lot) but they actually gave contractors extra pay for (COVID-19).
