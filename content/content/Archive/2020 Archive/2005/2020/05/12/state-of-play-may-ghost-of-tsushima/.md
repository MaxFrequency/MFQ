[Thursday’s State of Play is All About Ghost of Tsushima – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/05/12/thursdays-state-of-play-is-all-about-ghost-of-tsushima/)

> The episode will be focused entirely on Ghost of Tsushima, coming to PS4 July 17. You’ll get an extended look at new gameplay footage, including exploration, combat and more. The current cut is clocking in around 18 minutes, give or take.

Absolutely pumped to see the game in action outside of a [[../../../../../2003/2020/03/17/ghost-of-tsushima-japanese-story-trailer/|snazzy trailer]]. I want to see the game’s systems. What is similar to previous Sucker Punch games? Where has the studio broken new ground? Will PS4 console melt when all the petals are fluttering? Hope we can learn the answers to some of these questions on Thursday.
