[Meet The Newest Members Of The Kotaku Team (2020 Edition)](https://kotaku.com/meet-the-newest-members-of-the-kotaku-team-2020-editio-1843442203)

> I introduce them at a very different time in Kotaku’s history, a time when we’ve seen an unprecedented number of staffers leave for new adventures.

After a [[../../11/heather-alexandra-leaves-kotaku/|wave]] [[../../../../../2004/2020/04/28/maddy-myers-leaves-kotaku/|of]] [[../../../../../2004/2020/04/16/jason-schreier-leaves-kotaku/|departures]], Kotaku has new blood. It is great to see the site staff up.

> In 2012, I wrote that “Kotaku in 2012 will inform you, entertain you, and provoke you from time to time. If we do our jobs as reporters, writers, videographers, reviewers and opinionated essayists right, we’ll also keep surprising you.”
>
> In 2020, the goal’s the same.

Keep on keeping on Kotaku.
