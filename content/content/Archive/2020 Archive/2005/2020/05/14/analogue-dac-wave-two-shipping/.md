The second wave of DAC units has begun shipping, as [[../../../../../2004/2020/04/24/dac-delayed/|promised last month after a short delay]]. Excited to get my hands on it and test it out. With this and the Nt mini v2 behind them, all that Analogue has ahead of them is the Pocket, which I [[../../../../../2004/2020/04/22/analogue-pocket-preview/|previewed]] last month.
