[Sony Is Said to Plan PS5 Conference for as Early as Next Week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-27/sony-is-said-to-plan-ps5-conference-for-as-early-as-next-week)Â by Jason Schreier and Takashi Mochizuki for Bloomberg

> The virtual event could be held June 3, though some people also cautioned that plans have been in flux and that the date may change.

[[../../19/ps5-and-xbox-event-possibly-in-june/|More rumors and reports]] that indicate that Sony is revealing the PS5 properly next week. I am surprised that Sony has not given a date yet, if that is the case. The timing could be in flux due to COVID-19, but that seems light considering it is some sort of pre-recorded video that will be streamed.

Sony has another State of Play airing today, this time revolving around *The Last of Us Part II*. Maybe Sony will announce the PS5 event later this week as to not cloud the final big promotional push for *The Last of Us Part II*.
