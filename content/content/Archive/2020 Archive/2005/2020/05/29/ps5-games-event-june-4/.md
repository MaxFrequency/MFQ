[You’re Invited: A Look at the Future of Gaming on PlayStation 5 – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/05/29/youre-invited-a-look-at-the-future-of-gaming-on-playstation-5/)

> That’s why I’m excited to share that we will soon give you a first look at the games you’ll be playing after PlayStation 5 launches this holiday. The games coming to PS5 represent the best in the industry from innovative studios that span the globe. Studios, both larger and smaller, those newer and those more established, all have been hard at work developing games that will showcase the potential of the hardware.
> 
> This digital showcase will run for a bit more than an hour and, for the first time, we will all be together virtually experiencing the excitement together. A lack of physical events has given us an amazing opportunity to think differently and bring you on this journey with us, and hopefully, closer than ever before. This is part of our series of PS5 updates and, rest assured, after next week’s showcase, we will still have much to share with you.

Let’s. Go.

Actually knowing a date and time when Sony will be talking PS5 feels elating. The rush of excitement I felt when seeing confirmation was great. E3 may not be happening this year, but the spirit is still alive.

> But what is a launch without games?

What is a next-gen launch without games indeed. I am glad Sony is going to be talking about games. Hopefully, it is better than Microsoft’s first showing. If Sony steps to the plate and knocks out the games part of their reveal, they could regain significant ground in the mindshare. We know Microsoft is talking their first-party games in July. If Sony can reveal some absolute first-party [[../../12/playstation-studios-announced/|PlayStation Studios]] PS5 games, it will be a major win. Sony already had dominant chatter when they had exclusive association with the [[../../13/unreal-5-announced-ps5/|Unreal Engine 5 reveal]].

People care about gameplay.

With the focus also being on games, I have a feeling we will not see the console itself. That would also include a launch day and pricing. The summer is usually when those details are announced, so hopefully both major players will detail the actual launch of their consoles soon.

In an interview with [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/playstation-planning-june-4-ps5-event-ceo-says-supplies-look-good-for-launch/), PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan continued to reiterate that PS5 is on schedule for a holiday launch worldwide.

> “We’re going to launch this holiday, we will have a global launch.”
> 
> “Right now, we’re not seeing anything saying to us there’s going to be problems with quantities or we won’t be able to launch the way we want.”
