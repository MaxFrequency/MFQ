[What Casual Games Are Like For Someone Who Doesn’t Play Games – Razbuten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEP-RZtjUnU)

Razbuten’s videos are a treat. This is some great fun to watch, especially after watching the other experiment videos. 

Back in my days of yore (i.e. high school), with my profound wisdom of dating, I thought the coolest thing would be turning my girlfriend into a “gamer.” 

“I love this hobby, so she will too!”

I learned quickly that forcing my hobby onto someone is not how you get them to like it and is certainly not healthy for a relationship. People don’t always like the same thing, especially partners. 

Now with my wife Abby, I know that wholeheartedly. She does like some games and they are usually not the ones I have or will play. That’s perfectly okay! [[../../01/abby-animal-crossing-review/|She has already sunk 200+ hours into Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]. I have barely put in 15 hours. I love watching her discover what she loves and hearing her share it with me. That’s why I write about this industry; to share what I love with others. To watch Abby do the same with me is delightful.
