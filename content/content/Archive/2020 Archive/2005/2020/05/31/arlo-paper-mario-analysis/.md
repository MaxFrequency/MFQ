[Let’s Take a Real Close Look at That Origami King Trailer…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=embLJZEjWkU) by Arlo on YouTube

This analysis may not be [[../../20/paper-mario-origami-king-gamexplain-analysis/|as long as others]], but [[../../20/paper-mario-origami-king-arlo-reaction/|Arlo’s passion for Paper Mario]] makes this worth the watch. Cautious optimism is the right feeling to head into *The Origami King* with. I really hope this pans out for the series and for fans.
