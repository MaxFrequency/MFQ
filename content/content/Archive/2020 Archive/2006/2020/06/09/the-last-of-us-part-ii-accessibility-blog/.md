[The Last of Us Part II: Accessibility Features Detailed – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/06/09/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-features-detailed/)

> *The Last of Us Part II* features more than 60 accessibility settings, with expanded options focused on fine-motor and hearing, as well as completely new features that benefit low-vision and blind players. We encourage everyone to take advantage of these features to create a gameplay experience that’s right for them.

Even more in-depth details on the [[../../01/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility/|accessibility features]] in the *The Last of Us Part II*. There are fully settings for customizable controls, visibility, motion sickness, navigation, audio, and more. It is incredible to see these types of features built-in from the ground up for such a huge AAA game. Naughty Dog seems to be raising yet another bar here.

My personal favorite line in the break down though was this.

> Trophies are not limited by difficulty.

Fantastic.
