[Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition for PC – PC Features Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4St-fv53Q0&feature=youtu.be)

[[../../../../../2003/2020/03/25/horizon-zero-dawn-coming-to-pc/|Announced back in March]], *Horizon Zero Dawn* is finally making the transition to PC on August 7. It will be available on both Steam and the Epic Games Store for $49.99. It sports the typical PC features/settings like unlocked frame rates and ultra-wide resolutions. It’s exciting to finally be able to see what the [[../../../../../2001/2020/01/28/playstation-game-engines-decima-bubblebath/|Decima engine]] will be fully capable of on PC, alongside the imminent release of *[[../../../../../2006/2020/06/11/death-stranding-review/|Death Stranding]]* for PC.

I’m curious how many of these features will make their way to [[../../../../../2006/2020/06/12/ps5-games-reveal/|*Horizon Forbidden West* on PS5]]…and how much better the sequel will look. This will be a great move to get a wider audience jazzed for the sequel on PS5. Could certainly help move units early on.
