[『Ghost of Tsushima』時代劇映画風トレーラー](https://youtu.be/ZvF_dv5-aRI)

As Sony inches closer to the release of *Ghost of Tsushima*, the company releases more trailers. I have enjoyed watching both the Western and Eastern trailers for the game, given its world and story. 

I think the Japanese trailers are significantly cooler. Not only does this particular trailer show off more of the game, I feel like it matches the game and its themes much better. Either way, I am stoked to explore the island of Tsushima this weekend.
