[SGDQ 2020 Schedule](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule)

Games Done Quick is truly a weeklong highlight whenever it comes around. This summer’s marathon and fundraiser will be all online, which makes some of these speedruns even more unique, like the races and co-op runs. The marathon starts Sunday, August 16 at 11:30 AM EST.

Highlights for myself include the strong start with *Super Mario Odyssey* and *Shovel Knight: King of Cards* on day one, *Batman: Arkham City*, a warpless run of *Donkey Kong Country 2*, *Disney’s Extreme Skate Adventure* (because it is an all-time classic), an any% run of *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD*, the *Sonic* block on Wednesday, a race in *Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg*, a co-op randomizer run of *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*, a 1% hard race of *Metroid Fusion*, an “all dog treasures” run of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, and a 100% run of *Super Metroid*.

The schedule is looking strong this summer. I can’t wait to tune in.
