[First look: Box art for upcoming PS5 games – PlayStation.Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/07/09/first-look-box-art-for-upcoming-ps5-games/)

Sony is really leaning into this black and white theme. I can’t help but wish they’d change from the blue colored case to a smokey black one though. I think that’d look much slicker. The blue case from PS4 games (an obvious way to save money, they already have those cases by the pallet) sorely stick out. Nibel on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1281274801043189768/photo/1) whipped up a concept for a black and a clear box. I like the look of these much better.
