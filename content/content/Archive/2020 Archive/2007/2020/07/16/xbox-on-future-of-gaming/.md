[You Are the Future of Gaming](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/16/players-first-you-are-the-future-of-gaming/) by Phil Spencer for Xbox Wire

[[../../06/xbox-series-x-games-showcae/|One week ahead of the next Xbox 20/20 event]] that will focus on Xbox Studios games, Phil and the Xbox team shared a sort of quick hit bullet list of all the consumer-focused pros that the Xbox ecosystem has steadily built over the generation. Xbox truly is diversifying access to their platform. They are becoming the melting pot of gaming, taking the best ideas from competitors and leveraging Microsoft’s technology (and bankroll) to build the best ecosystem out there.

> Xbox Series X is designed to deliver a new level of fidelity, feel, performance and precision never seen before in console gaming. All games will look and play best on Xbox Series X

Reaffirming that the Series X will be the best place to play Xbox Game Studios’ titles. I also see this as a subtle hint toward the [[../../../../../2006/2020/06/30/xbox-lockhart-original-plans/|Xbox Series S]], which has been rumored for quite a while now. “The Series X will be the best place, but we will give you options,” is how I read that statement.

> We want every Xbox player to play all the new games from Xbox Game Studios. That’s why Xbox Game Studios titles we release in the next couple of years—like Halo Infinite—will be available and play great on Xbox Series X and Xbox One. We won’t force you to upgrade to Xbox Series X at launch to play Xbox exclusives.

Again reaffirming cross-generational support. Extremely consumer friendly, but am still curious what this means for developers. Here’s what I [[../../../../../2006/2020/06/30/xbox-lockhart-original-plans/|wrote]] when the last big leak for the Series S occurred:

> Microsoft will have two new boxes, with different performance, plus continuing cross-generation support for the Xbox One. Halo Infinite could be playable on six different pieces of hardware; Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PC (what a naming nightmare). That has to be a testing and optimizing mountain to climb.

And I forgot that all of the Xbox Game Studios’ titles will be on xCloud as well. While hardware performance will not be so much of an issue for xCloud, the quality and performance of the stream will be.

> Finally, today we’re announcing that this September, in supported countries, we’re bringing Xbox Game Pass and Project xCloud together at no additional cost for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members.

Speaking of xCloud, an official public launch window has finally been given. I wonder if older Xbox One consoles will support xCloud streaming. Say you own an OG Xbox One (like I do) and *Halo Infinite* runs below 1080p when natively installed. What if you could stream the 1080p version via xCloud? I know that the Xbox One S has 4K video output capabilities. Why not allow users to stream the native 4K version of *Halo Infinite* to their Xbox One S? Microsoft may lose the initial sale of the shiny new box, but they could be gaining a new monthly subscriber to Game Pass Ultimate. At $15 a month, that may seem like the more appealing choice to folks hesitant to upgrading their box, especially if it can run the newer games through streaming.

> It’s our intent for all Xbox One games that do not require Kinect to play on Xbox Series X at the launch of the console.

RIP Kinect. I wonder if the [dongle](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Kinect-Adapter-One-Windows-10/dp/B01GVE4YB4) will work with Series X…

> We hope you’ll join us next Thursday, July 23rd for the Xbox Games Showcase for the first look at the *Halo Infinite* Campaign and more.

Way to bury the lede Phil!
