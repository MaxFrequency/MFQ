[Microsoft discontinues Xbox One X and Xbox One S digital edition ahead of Series X launch](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327330/microsoft-xbox-one-x-s-digital-edition-discontinued) by Tom Warren for The Verge

> “As we ramp into the future with Xbox Series X, we’re taking the natural step of stopping production on Xbox One X and Xbox One S All-Digital Edition,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “Xbox One S will continue to be manufactured and sold globally.”

That’s one way to clear out the inventory. Ironically, I was looking up Xbox One S prices yesterday for a friend and noticed that no major retailers appeared to have any Xbox systems in stock. I attributed this to a retailer shortage due to COVID-19, but it sounds like Microsoft themselves are pulling the plug. Why spend the money building consoles that will be obsoleted in a few months? Especially if players will be able to stream newer Xbox games in their higher fidelity to the Xbox One S. While this will slightly help with store shelves and consumer confusion, especially between “Xbox One X” and “Xbox Series X.” Now all we can hope for is that the rumored, weaker next-gen Xbox is *not* called “Xbox Series S.”
