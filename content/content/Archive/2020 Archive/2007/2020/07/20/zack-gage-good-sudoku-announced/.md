[Good Sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/#download)

iOS game developer wizard Zack Gage has revealed their next game and it is coming out in three days. Made by Zach and Jack Schlesinger, *Good Sudoku* pitches itself as more than a clean puzzle app, but also as an AI-powered teacher to make players better at the game.

I grew up doing sudoku puzzles thanks to my grandmother and [*Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day!). Iâ€™ve always wanted a clean, straight-forward Sudoku app for my phone, but found the offerings on the App Store to be flimsy and or sketchy. *Good Sudoku* looks like what I have been waiting for.
