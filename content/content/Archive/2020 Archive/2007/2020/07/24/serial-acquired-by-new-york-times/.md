[Introducing: Nice White Parents — Serial](https://overcast.fm/+DfQO9Rb-4)

> The New York Times Company has agreed to buy Serial Productions, the company behind the hit podcast “Serial,” The Times said on Wednesday, in the paper’s latest move to broaden its digital journalism.

Two birds with one stone in this announcement: Interesting to see The New York Times put their bid in the podcast space. Rather than [buying a preexisting podcast network](https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/spotify-gimlet-media-podcast-deal.html), the Times has purchased a production company. This is also better than a service exclusively buying Serial produced podcasts, like [Spotify with Joe Rogan](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/25/joe-rogan-got-ripped-off). Serial now has better financial backing to make better and more shows that will be available as an open and available podcast.

Nice White Parents sounds right up the alley of Serial-style podcasts. Excited to listen to it when it airs on July 30.
