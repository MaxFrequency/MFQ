[The Legend of Zelda: The Missing Link](https://tml.z64.me/)

[Trailer](https://youtu.be/LM8Nc13bkGg)

This has been sitting in my blog post queue for a while. Nearly a month ago now, I saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/SuperZambezi/status/1287087202959101952) for Michael Koczwara and immediately downloaded this fan patch. I played the game over the course of a few nights; all-in-all it took me between 3-4 hours to beat. It’s a fun, puzzle-focused *Zelda* game. It’s got original music that has a catchy earworm quality to it.

I played the game on my Mac with a CRT filter and used a [[../when-did-i-get-so-many-controllers/|N64 to Wiimote adapter to play with a real N64 controller]]. There is a certain level of camera jankiness that I don’t recall from *Ocarina of Time*, which [I last played in just over a year ago in 2019](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1154514604266938369). The final boss in particular, while featuring a rad design, had some serious camera issues that frustrated me. Overall, it’s a fun fan-mod that is totally worth checking out if you are into *Zelda* on the N64.
