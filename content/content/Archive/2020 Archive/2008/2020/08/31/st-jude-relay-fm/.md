Every year the folks over at [Relay FM run a fundraising campaign for St. Jude’s children hospital](https://tiltify.com/@relay-fm/relay-fm-for-st-jude). St. Jude conducts research, provides treatment, housing, and much more for children with cancer. Their mission is to make sure no child dies from cancer.

I started really listening to Relay FM weekly since early last year. My wife and I were blessed enough to donate (plus my employer matched it) last September. This year, we are still blessed and fortunate enough to donate. I wanted to also use this small platform to spread the word about St. Jude and this campaign. Every bit helps these kids and their families.
