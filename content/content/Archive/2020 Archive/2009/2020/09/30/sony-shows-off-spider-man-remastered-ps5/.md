[Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered detailed](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/30/marvels-spider-man-remastered-detailed/) by James Stevenson for the PlayStation Blog

[Public confusion about upgrade paths and access aside](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/09/25/sony-needs-a-less-ridiculous-upgrade-path-for-spider-man-on-ps5/#1dad7ead5ff3); Holy cow! Taking a two year old game and slapping a new *code* of paint on it is yielding incredible results. I am so flipping stoked to see ray tracing on my own TV and games. I am curious what the final resolution will be for both the “[Performance Mode](https://youtu.be/acuscewbkxI)” with its 60fps and the normal 30fps mode.

The other big news is the entirely new face of Peter Parker. Like, Insomniac cast an entirely different face. It’s [wild](https://youtu.be/-i5tTKSbePI).

> This does bring us to one of the bigger changes. In order to bring the best performances to players with our next-generation *Marvel’s Spider-Man* games, we have recast the face of Peter Parker. We loved working with John Bubniak on the original game; however, to get a better match to Peter Parker/Spider-Man actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture, we have cast Ben Jordan to be the face model for Peter Parker on the PS5 console. He looks incredible in-game, and Yuri’s moving performances take on a new life.

The technical reasoning makes sense. It’s hardly a secret that Insomniac is working on a proper Marvel’s Spider-Man sequel. Building this next-gen model of Peter is the right call for the development process, especially if Peter makes an appearance in *Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales*. It’s just strange that [Peter now looks younger than Miles](https://twitter.com/MooreMan12/status/1311353663345098758). Sure, the comparison shots in that particular tweet show Miles one year after the events of *Marvel’s Spider-Man*, but it’s not like Miles was a spring chicken in that game either. I wonder if they tweaked other main characters like Mary Jane or Miles. Heck, did [Aunt May get the younger treatment](https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/df-30062r-copy.jpg?resize=800,533)?
