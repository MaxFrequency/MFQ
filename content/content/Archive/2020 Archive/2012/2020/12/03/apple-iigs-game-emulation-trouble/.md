I am practically at my wits’ end. I just want to play three Apple IIGS games, two of which seem to be exclusive to that particular iteration of Apple’s famous computer. Search after search has led my to various apps and emulators that either run [Apple IIe tier games](https://www.virtualii.com/), [are not 64-bit compatible](http://www.sheppyware.net/software-mac/sweet16/), or require [odd web browsers and extensions](https://www.virtualapple.org/).

Maybe I don’t know enough about older computing commands, coding, etc. I can’t even *really* figure out if something like the Raspberry Pi can emulate the Apple IIGS and its games. Maybe this kinda of emulation is easier on Windows PC (which would be ironic to say the least).

This strikes me as so odd for this sort of game emulation to be so convoluted. It is easier to jailbreak an iPhone, [[../../../../../2005/2020/05/11/gamecube-wii-on-ios/|install emulators]], and play Nintendo DS games on the phone. Why does this era of early home PC gaming have such a technological hurdle to even attempt? I’ve even looked into Amiga ports for the games I am looking at and the emulation doesn’t seem any more clear on that front. Maybe it is due to having to emulate an operating system underneath the game’s code?

These past two or so weeks have been incredible frustrating for this little side project. I just want to play a few obscure Apple IIGS games? Is that too much to ask for?
