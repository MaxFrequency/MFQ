[Analogue Nt mini Noir – The Ultimate NES FPGA console? RGB321 MY LIFE IN GAMING – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJnwmy78zn4)

Nothing quite like a brand new MLiG video to kick off the weekend. Coury and Try go over every perceivable inch of the revised [Nt mini Noir from Analogue](https://www.analogue.co/editions/nt-mini-noir), which no one can buy.

Maybe I should have gotten one of these instead of a PS5…Kidding aside, I always love MLiG’s videos and find them satisfying and oddly soothing. It is definitely worth the watch whether you copped a Nt mini Noir or passed.

Seeing the tech inside the Nt mini Noir reminds me that the [[../../../../../2004/2020/04/22/analogue-pocket-preview/|Pocket]] is only supposed to be [[../../../../../2008/2020/08/03/analogue-pocket-sold-out-10-minutes/|five months away]]. I am eagerly anticipating my own Pocket console and the newly announced Analogue Duo. I really should dig into that one soon.
