[Focusing on Stadia’s future as a platform, and winding down SG&E](https://blog.google/products/stadia/focusing-on-stadias-future-as-a-platform-and-winding-down-sge/) by Phil Harrison, Vice President and GM of Google Stadia

> Creating best-in-class games from the ground up takes many years and significant investment, and the cost is going up exponentially. Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games. With the increased focus on using our technology platform for industry partners, Jade Raymond has decided to leave Google to pursue other opportunities. We greatly appreciate Jade’s contribution to Stadia and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors. Over the coming months, most of the SG&E team will be moving on to new roles. We’re committed to working with this talented team to find new roles and support them.

Google’s own studio didn’t even [last two years](https://youtube.com/watch?v=nUih5C5rOrA&t=3207).

Google hired former Head of Sony Santa Monica, Shannon Studstill, not [even one year ago](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/04/google-hires-sonys-shannon-studstill-to-run-stadia-games-and-entertainment-studio-in-la/).

This is, unfortunately, not surprising. The clock is ticking for Stadia on the whole. Real glad I got a controller and Chromecast for [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2012/2020/12/16/google-stadia-2020-impressions/|free]] late last year. When Google is practically handing out hardware, you know the end is near. This seems extremely disappointing for Jade Raymond, Shannon Studstill, and all the top developers that Google has hired over the last two years. Shame we’ll never play what they were working on.
