[N64Digital Roadmap](https://www.pixelfx.co/content/roadmap.html)

PixelFX has revealed their roadmap for the [[../../../../../2101/2021/01/30/pixel-fx-n64digital-citrus3000psi-chriz2600-woozle64/|N64Digital]]. This gives us a bit of insight to the specs behind the N64Digital. I find the biggest feature to be system compatibility with all N64 models. RGB mods for the N64 require a certain model number. I’m not sure if the Ultra HDMI mod requires a certain model number, but in my few minutes of research I couldn’t find anything indicating so.

The N64Digital will go up to 1200p, which is a 5x increase over 240p N64 games and a 2.5x increase over 480i supported games. The board also enables RBG/YPbPr analog output through the N64’s standard multiout port. This would allow the use of RBG or component cables, like HD Retrovision’s SNES cables.

You can see the whole roadmap at the link above, but it is exciting to see the initial launch plans for the N64Digital. It makes waiting for April even harder.
