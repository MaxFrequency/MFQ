Straight from citrus3000psi on the shmups forums. Nice to know the price for the N64Digital is in line with the PS1Digital. Although, I find it even more interesting that the price was lower before adding in the DAC for RGB output and the “filter,” which I take to mean the advanced smoothing filters detailed in the [[../../03/n64digital-roadmap-revealed/|roadmap]].

All that is left is a specific date in April and to see the mod in action. I can’t wait.
