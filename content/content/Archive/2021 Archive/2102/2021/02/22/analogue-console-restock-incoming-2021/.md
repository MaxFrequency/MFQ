By the time the restocks come to fruition, [[../../../../../2101/2021/01/06/analogue-consoles-out-of-stock-jan-2021/|everything will have been out-of-stock for 3-4 months]]. The Super NT has been [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2002/2020/02/07/super-nt-black-color-variant-returns/|flickering]] out of stock since early 2020, while the Mega SG finally went out after Christmas 2020 along with the [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2005/2020/05/26/analogue-dac-review/|DAC]]. It is great to see Analogue restocking the consoles, especially the Super NT. We also just crossed the sub-100 days left until the end of May 2021, which is the current release window for the [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2008/2020/08/03/analogue-pocket-sold-out-10-minutes/|Pocket]]. The Duo is also supposed to be releasing this year. It seems Analogueâ€™s production is kicking back up, but we have to see if it can keep up with demand.
