[[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2021/03/06/mfp-0/|It was inevitable]], wasn’t it? Heck, in my very [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2001/2020/01/07/welcome/|first post]] I left the door open for returning to podcasting.

> I like what I came up with—Max Frequency. It communicates the identity of the blog quite well, I think. It’s me at my frequency. No pressures for deadlines, no list of required news. Only articles that I want to write or share. It also opens up the possibility for audio content if I ever get behind the mic again. Plus, it is a pun.

After recording [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/05/chasing-the-stick/|Chasing the Stick: The History of Naughty Dog during the PS4 Era]], I realized how much I missed podcasting. I’ve had ideas kicking around for years for shows. I decided to stop kicking the proverbial can around. I’m back.

The show is unabashedly inspired by [The Talk Show with John Gruber from Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/). Three times a month, different guests/friends each episode talking about current events or whatever floats their boat. It mirrors the style of my blog effortlessly. I want to podcast at my frequency. So here I am.

You’ll find the first episode here. You can subscribe with the [RSS feed](https://maxfrequency.libsyn.com/rss) in your podcast app of choice or go for [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-max-frequency-podcast/id1557043396) and/or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3W1LwBNmhZ6s5QmQViWXKn).

Also, over the next few months, I’ll be reuploading my old interview show *Behind the Pixel* to this feed as well. I never liked the fact that when we closed *Model Citizens Media* that those episodes vanished from podcast services. They can live in the early days of this feed and I’ll feel better.

I hope you enjoy the show.
