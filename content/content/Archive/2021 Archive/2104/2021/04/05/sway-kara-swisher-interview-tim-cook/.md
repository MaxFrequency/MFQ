[Kara Swisher Interviews Apple CEO Cook for Sway](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sway/id1528594034) by Kara Swisher for The New York Times’ Sway via [John Voorhees at MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/news/kara-swisher-interviews-apple-ceo-cook-for-sway/)

I always look forward to interviews with top Apple brass. It is rare to get one-on-one time with them to ask questions and learn more about them, their role within the company, and how decisions are made at Apple. Kara Swisher asks about privacy, the new App Tracking Transparency, Epic’s lawsuit against Apple, and so on. Tim leans into an emphasis on curation in the App Store, which is hard to imagine with the scale of apps available and are likely submitted daily. Swisher does a great job and I’m glad I found this interview.
