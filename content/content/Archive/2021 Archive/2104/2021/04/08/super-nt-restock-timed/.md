This is no different than the Pocket pre-order structure. I’m curious if it too will [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2008/2020/08/03/analogue-pocket-sold-out-10-minutes/|sell out in 10 minutes]]. Hopefully, Analogue’s recent openness about their [[../../../../../2102/2021/02/23/analogue-pocket-limited-quantity-edition-supply-chain-release/|supply chain and ordering process]] will turn into action as these restocks happen before [[../../../../../2103/2021/03/31/analogue-pocket-delayed-oct-2021/|Pocket’s launch in October]].
