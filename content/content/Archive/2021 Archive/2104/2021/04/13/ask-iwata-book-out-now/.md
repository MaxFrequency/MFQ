*Ask Iwata: Words of Wisdom from Satoru Iwata, Nintendo’s Legendary CEO* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/197472154X/)

This collection of writings, speeches, and lessons from Iwata-san has finally been translated to English and released. I’ve only read the preface and have already gotten choked up. Iwata-san was and still is a legend with a clearly joy-driven personality that truly shined at Nintendo. His “Iwata Asks” series at Nintendo is a fountain of insight, one I often go to when looking up special stories of Nintendo and its games.

He shepherded hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life into the world of video games like [[../../../../../../2018 Archive/1811/2018/11/18/tetris-effect-review-the-puzzle-icon-reimagined/|my grandmother]] through the Game Boy, the Nintendo DS, and the Wii. He played a critical role in bringing joy to gamers around the world. It wasn’t some exclusive club to him. It was a way to bring people from all walks of life together through play and joy.

I am excited to learn more about his way of thinking, his love of play, and his legacy. If you want to have a good cry, you can watch the videos I linked below.
