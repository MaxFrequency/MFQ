✨ Playdate Update — 6/8/2021 on YouTube

Oooooo baby! The Playdate has been on my radar since its initial announcement. I think I have signed up for notifications across three different email addresses, just by accident. I have loved seeing little teases from Panic and devs that have their hands on one, like davemakes from *[[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2008/2020/08/10/*Mixolumia*-puzzle-game-treat-davemakes/|Mixolumia]]*! No more teases though, as Panic just put out a Nintendo Direct-style video revealing all sorts of goodness. 

# Season 1 Has Doubled

A unique part of Playdate is that the games for it are being released weekly as a part of Season 1, which is included with the Playdate. The games are yours to keep, no subscription here for the first season. That quantity of games has doubled from 12 to 24! Devs I recognized were Zach Gage, Bennett Foddy, and davemakes. Lucas Pope, creator of *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *Papers, Please* is also making a game for it too!

# There’s a Dock/Speaker/Pen Holder

I want this on my desk ASAP.

# Poolsuite FM is gonna be there

Yes. Give me.

# Pre-orders Start in July

Sounds like Panic is making an initial order of 20,000 Playdates and selling them for $179. No word on the cost of the Dock. Panic will give everyone a week’s notice to the pre-order date. First come, first serve, with a goal to start shipping later this year. Orders won’t shut down though, if the initial order is sold through. Panic is keeping orders open!

# The Created a Game Making App too

Playdate Pulp is a web-browser based game maker. People can whip up games for their Playdate and put them right on the console! It’s very cute and reminds me a lot of *Mario Maker* and *Mario Paint*. 

As Panic’s first foray into hardware, it really looks like they are hitting the nail on the head. Wholly unique in a refreshing way. I am really eager to get my hands on this console and that sweet, sweet crank.
