Hopefully their ordering system can sustain the demand. No word on quantity, so I expect they’ll sell out rather quick. After being [[../../../../../2101/2021/01/06/analogue-consoles-out-of-stock-jan-2021/|out of stock since January 2021]] and a [[../../../../../2104/2021/04/08/super-nt-restock-timed/|small restock]], hopefully these stay up for a smidgen longer.

If you want any other these devices, I’d prepare for Monday. Personally, I love my [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2001/2020/01/14/super-nt/|Super NT]] and [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2005/2020/05/26/analogue-dac-review/|DAC]]. I hope this is a good sign that the [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2004/2020/04/22/analogue-pocket-preview/|Analogue Pocket]] will hit the [[../../../../../2103/2021/03/31/analogue-pocket-delayed-oct-2021/|October 2021]] delivery window, after being delayed out of May 2021 and late 2020.
