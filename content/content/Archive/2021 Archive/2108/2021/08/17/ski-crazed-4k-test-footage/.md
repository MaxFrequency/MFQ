[*Ski Crazed*, 1986 Apple II – 4K CRT Footage with MiSTER FPGA | Chasing the Stick](https://youtu.be/sEp5G811emo) by Me on YouTube

As I figure out writing [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/05/chasing-the-stick/|Chasing the Stick]] as a [[../../../../../2103/2021/03/15/announcing-cts-2/|real life book]], I have begun slowly gathering my own footage and photos of the games in as high of a quality as I can. This is [[../../../../../2103/2021/03/27/mister-review/|why I bought and built a MiSTer FPGA console]]!

So a couple weeks ago, I tested recording my CRT in 4K while playing the second game published by Jason Rubin and Andy Gavin – *Ski Crazed* for the Apple II. I don’t know quite what to do with the footage, so rather than sit on it, I decided to upload it to YouTube and learn from some mistakes I made.

One setting I need to lock down is the ISO. I had it set to automatic, which led to the blowouts between screen transitions. Also, the audio may not be synced up properly. That’s because I was capturing the audio digitally through the MiSTer’s HDMI port, but I was not capturing the analog sound. So there wasn’t a clean way to sync the two. My apologies.

I’m not confident in the framerate selection either. My Canon EOS 90D captures 4K30. The game runs at 60fps. So do I sacrifice the frames for resolution or give up the 4K dream in favor of a more accurate framerate? I am not sure yet; after uploading and thinking about it, I am sort of leaning toward the frame rate option. We shall see!
