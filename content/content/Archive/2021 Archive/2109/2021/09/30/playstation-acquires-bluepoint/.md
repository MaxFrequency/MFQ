[Welcoming Bluepoint Games to the PlayStation Studios family](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/30/welcoming-bluepoint-games-to-the-playstation-studios-family/) by Hermen Hulst on the PlayStation Blog

> Today I’m very excited to announce that PlayStation Studios has grown again with the addition of long-time partner Bluepoint Games! From the exceptional PS5 remake of *Demon’s Souls* to the critically acclaimed PS4 remake of *Shadow of the Colossus* and remasters of fan favorites like *Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection*, Bluepoint has built a name for itself by creating some of the highest-quality remasters and remakes in the industry.
