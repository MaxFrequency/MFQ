[*Forza Horizon 5*: Every Xbox Version Tested – Xbox Series S/X vs Xbox One S/X!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGo8pU_Sm8w) by Digital Foundry on YouTube

It’s a [secret to everybody](http://secrettoeverybody.com/) that [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2009/2020/09/22/cross-gen-bottleneck-ps5-xbox/|I have concerns about cross-generational games]]. I have to give credit where it is due though. It looks like Playground Games has absolutely crushed it with *Forza Horizon 5*. My favorite part was the footage at Playground Games, [where Rich saw their testing set-up](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iGo8pU_Sm8w&t=240) for Xbox Series consoles in their respective performance and quality modes and the base Xbox One dev kits. I totally respect the team for not forgetting the base Xbox One.

While it does look amazing on old hardware, I still have to imagine what the game could have been if they had dropped Xbox One support from the outset. We’ll find out with the inevitable *Forza Horizon 6*.

I also can’t wait to see how Sony’s development teams fare in their upcoming cross-gen titles. I have a tough time imagining scalability and performance of this caliber. Bravo Playground Games, bravo.
