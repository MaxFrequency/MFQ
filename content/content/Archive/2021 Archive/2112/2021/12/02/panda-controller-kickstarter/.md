[The Panda Controller by Panda Hardware — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pandahardware/the-panda-controller)

If you had told me back in 2007 that [Samurai Panda of *Show Me Your News!*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Show_Me_Your_News) would make a pro GameCube controller some day, my 13-year-old mind would have been blown. I still remember him talking about removing the springs in the triggers for faster shields/dodge rolls.

This new GameCube controller is smashing through its Kickstarter goals. The customization on display here reminds me of the Xbox Elite Series controller or the SCUF pro controllers. The GameCube controller is one of the longest lasting form-factors and supported controllers ever. Stoked to see this kind of controller entering the market.

Also, the Panda Controller has height-adjustable triggers.

> [!warning] Update (12/29/21): 
> The Panda controller Kickstarter has been [cancelled](https://www.panda.gg/news/ks-update) due to supply chain constraints. Panda did not want to take folks’ money without being able to provide a launch window.
