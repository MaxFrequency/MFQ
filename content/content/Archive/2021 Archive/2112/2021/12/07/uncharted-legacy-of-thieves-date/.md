Launching on January 28, this is actually a couple months sooner than I expected. Now Sony has big titles for the first three months of 2022 with *Uncharted*, *Horizon: Forbidden West*, and *Gran Turismo 7*. This comes out right before the *Uncharted* movie, which I knew would be their goal. I just figured that they would have given us that date sooner if that was the case. I am very happy to see it so soon.

The real treat is the visual modes offered:

[*Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection* – Details on the remastered bundle](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/07/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-details-on-the-remastered-bundle/) by Annabelle Hua for the PlayStation Blog

> Fidelity Mode – For those of you who have a 4K display and want super sharp resolution above all else to enjoy the stunning environments and details the Uncharted series is known for, select Fidelity Mode and play in native 4K resolution with a 30fps target framerate.
> 
> Performance Mode – We carried over the high framerate PS4 patch with Performance Mode, which targets a 60fps frame rate.
> 
> Performance+ Mode – If you’re all about the smoothest gameplay possible and don’t mind a resolution drop, try out our first ever Performance+ Mode which targets 120fps* at a 1080p resolution.

Native 4K will look *sweet*, but the “target” framerate of 30fps raises a flag. I would think it could be a locked, stable 30. We’ll have to wait for release to see if it even dips: I could be speculating about nothing. The real surprise is 120fps support at 1080p. I can just imagine swinging on the rope and leaping into a [[../../../../../../../../../docs/assets/img/superman_punch.gif|Superman punch]] at 120. Gimme.
