[I’m Done Being a Content Creator.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nJ2otNy1cs) by Carlos Eiene (insaneintherainmusic) for YouTube

What a transparent and honest way to kickstart 2022. Carlos’ words ring true with my own story of realizing I didn’t want to play the game of chasing games journalism. I have a passion for writing and video games, not the game of making it my job (as that game currently stands). Carlos has worked extremely hard and is fortunate enough to have actually make producing these covers his job. He’s made a big move to start 2022, which sounds like the right one after listening to him.
