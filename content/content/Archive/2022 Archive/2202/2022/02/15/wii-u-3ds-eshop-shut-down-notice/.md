[Wii U & Nintendo 3DS eShop Discontinuation](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/57847) via an official [tweet](https://twitter.com/nintendoamerica/status/1493752880733503488)

> As of late March 2023, it will no longer be possible to make Nintendo eShop purchases for the Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS family of systems.

> As of August 29, 2022, it will no longer be possible to use a Nintendo eShop Card to add funds to an account in Nintendo eShop on Wii U or the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. However, it will still be possible to redeem download codes until late March 2023.

It was inevitable, but that does not make it less disappointing. Nice of them to give consumers 13 months worth of lead time. The concerning bit is that Nintendo claims to have no other plans to release or provide access to older games outside of NSO. I should say claimed, since the [statement](https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1493754408215085056) has been deleted. Frank Cifaldi of the Video Game History Foundation gives your [permission](https://twitter.com/frankcifaldi/status/1493767101772824586) to find access.

At least thereâ€™s a neat [site](https://my-nintendo-3ds-wiiu-memories.nintendo.com/en-US/index.html#top) that shows you your top played games on each of these platforms.
