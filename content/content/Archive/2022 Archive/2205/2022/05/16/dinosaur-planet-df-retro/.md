[DF Retro: *Dinosaur Planet* – Inside Rare’s Lost N64 Game + *Star Fox Adventures* Comparisons!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFalhK5DLVM&t=1s) by John Linneman for Digital Foundry

[[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 3 - Banjo-Kazooie/chapterselect/season3/|Spending so much time with *Banjo-Kazooie* lately for Chapter Select]] reminded me of Rare’s *Dinosaur Planet*. I remember the build leaking last year and Digital Foundry publishing this analysis, but I never got around to watching it. Now in full blown Rare mode, I’ve finally come back to watch. A fascinating look at [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2009/2020/09/22/cross-gen-bottleneck-ps5-xbox/|cross-generational development]] back in the early 2000s. We don’t get leaps like this between console generations anymore.
