[Metal Gear Solid 4 Needs to Be Remastered Now More Than Ever](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-4-mgs4-remaster-remake-opinion/) by Logan Moore for Comicbook.com

> Well, MGS4 is a game that has never been released on a platform outside of PlayStation 3. As such, the most accessible way to play the game in recent years was likely through PS Now. Assuming your Internet connection was strong enough, this allowed users on PS4 and PS5 to still play the game on their consoles without needing to have an actual PS3 at their disposal. In less than a week, though, this might no longer be true, which means that Metal Gear Solid 4 could be gridlocked entirely on PS3…

> …To not have the full Metal Gear Solid series playable and easily accessible in 2022 is essentially a crime against video games. Not to mention, Metal Gear Solid 4 is just an awesome game in its own right that more people need to revisit or be able to play for the first time without having to jump through so many hoops. This entry is one of the most unique in the series and serves as the chronological end to the franchise’s sprawling, insane narrative. To be unable to see the end of the Metal Gear story arc without owning a legacy PlayStation console is just disappointing.

Considering I just let a friend borrow my PS3 and *Metal Gear Solid 4*, I’d have to agree that a proper port is over due.
