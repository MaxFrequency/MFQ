[[../../../../../../2021 Archive/2104/2021/04/09/naughty-dog-blockbuster-remake-the-last-of-us-uncharted-bend/|Michael Mumbauer]] has left That’s No Moon Entertainment roughly [[../../../../../../2021 Archive/2107/2021/07/28/thats-no-moon-announced/|one year after]] founding said developer. That’s No Moon was co-founded with a three other devs, including former PlayStation and Naughty Dog developer Taylor Kurosaki. Michael’s new studio – Liithos – is co-founded with John Garvin of PlayStation studio Bend fame.

They are wholly leaning into Web3. A slate of NFTs already for sale.

I wonder how long Michael will stay at Liithos.

Update: Michael and John were clearly not in the room together when [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FV8FAyDUsAAEpQx?format=jpg) photo was taken/made. Reminds me of [Beyoncé](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alliehayes/john-oliver-beyonce-photoshop-lion-king).
