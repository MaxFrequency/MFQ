Here is 4K60 gameplay from the [PS5 remake](https://youtu.be/dyBA6JpCtkU).

And here is the same portion of gameplay at 720p on the [PS3](https://youtu.be/l25uL979jMw).

Let’s not forget the [PS4 remaster](https://youtu.be/o1fOlcylVKQ) at 1080p either.

I find the most powerful element from this *Part I* footage to be that the game looks like I remember it. But when you go back thirteen years to the Cell processor and see what it actually looked like…*The Last of Us* in 2013 is a testament to the immersive “[[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/05/chasing-the-stick/|on the stick]]” design that Naughty Dog strives for.

Side Note: Listen with headphones if you can. Some of the 3D audio design comes through as well.
