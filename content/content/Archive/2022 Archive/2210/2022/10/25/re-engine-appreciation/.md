This has been a post I’ve had in the draft folder for [some time](https://twitter.com/MaxRoberts143/status/1536756048945717248). I’ve been spending a lot of time with the RE Engine lately, thanks to working on [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 5 - Resident Evil/chapterselect/season5/|Season 5 – Resident Evil]] for [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|chapterselect/]]. I decided it is time to crank this one out.

Holy smokes Capcom has a dope game engine!

The RE Engine made its debut with *Resident Evil VII: biohazard* in 2017. The “RE” would imply *Resident Evil*, but I guess it stands for “Reach for the Moon Engine.” Capcom has certainly done that. A new engine made sense for a reinvention of the franchise. Utilizing both a first-person perspective and implementing a fully playable VR version of the game dictated a need for new tech.

Since *RE7*‘s release, Capcom has turned the *Resident Evil* engine into the Capcom Engine. There are currently a total of 17 games that use the RE Engine. The real dope part is how diverse that catalog of games is and how many different platforms are supported.

While the bulk are third-person action/shooters, RE Engine also supports first-person games, VR, 2D platformers, retro-emulated arcade games, fighting games, action games, and online multiplayer games. The list of hardware is even longer with

- Xbox One
- PlayStation 4 / PSVR
- Nintendo Switch
- Xbox Series consoles
- PlayStation 5 / PSVR2
- PC
- Apple Silicon-based Mac computers
- Cloud-streaming platforms

The spread here is wide. And with that spread, comes a slew of technical capabilities. My PS5 version of *RE7* has options for raytracing and 120fps, while the Switch cloud version varies. *Resident Evil Village* hits Apple Silicon Mac computers next week. I am curious how it performs on my M1 iMac compared to a maxed out M1 Ultra and a beefy PC.

Outside of spooky time games, Capcom making this [the backbone of *Street Fighter VI* is serious](https://twitter.com/streetfighter/status/1533101503417921536). The style is off the charts and early impressions indicate the gameplay is solid.

Compared to the likes of Ubisoft’s Snowdrop and EA’s Frostbite, the RE Engine just seems better. RE Engine appears to be more flexible than Snowdrop, which is primarily used for online shooters, open-world RPGs, and *Rabbids* games (*Mario + Rabbids* does look beautiful). Frostbite is notorious for being a FPS engine stretched out for sports and massive RPGs. Credit where it is due though: while writing this, I checked what engine *NFS Unbound* uses and it is reportedly Frostbite. The new *Need for Speed* has a unique style to it, not far off from *Street Fighter VI* actually. Graffiti is [so hot](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-is-so-hot-right-now) right now.

With a new update for *Resident Evil Village* out soon[^1] and the ground-up remake of *Resident Evil 4*, I am going to spending a fair chunk of time with Capcom’s game engine. It’s almost as exciting as the games themselves.
