For the past two years, my friends and I travel to be together and watch Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards in person. There’s nothing like the swirl of hype, drawn out productions, and off-screen awarding when together with friends.

I won’t be able to attend our annual gathering this year, since Eloise was born and I used up all my PTO for her arrival. So to tap into the excitement for The Game Awards, I thought I’d whip up some brief predictions for this year’s show.

- *Elden Ring* will take the Game of the Year.
- *God of War: Ragnarök* will snag the Best Narrative.
- *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* will be crowned the most anticipated game.

For Geoff’s regularly scheduled reveals, I have some guesses too.

- Naughty Dog shows off something, probably their multiplayer game.
- Nintendo graces the show with *Tears of the Kingdom* gameplay.
- *Starfield* gets a snazzy trailer and date.
- *Half-Life: Alyx* for PS VR2 announced.

There’s a lot of classic Geoff-hype that Neil Druckmann, Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, Pedro Pascal, and Bella Ramsey will be presenting at the show. A buddy of mine pointed out that Naughty Dog changed their Twitter profile picture to a frosted paw-print. At Summer Game Fest, Naughty Dog revealed the first piece of concept art for their *TLOU* multiplayer game. I could see them taking the next step at The Game Awards this year.

Who could forget the [legendary off-screen gameplay reveal](https://youtu.be/SECWlFInyFM) of *Breath of the Wild* (known then only as *The Legend of Zelda* for Wii U)? Please repeat history Nintendo.

*Starfield* feels like a lock. Delayed the game out of the summer, so it feels like the right time to give the game a date with so many eyes on the event. Microsoft needs *Starfield* to come out swinging: Although, Nintendo sold 10+ million copies of *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Violet*, which are Jank City, so maybe *Starfield* can come out as a mess too.

This prediction is the reason I wrote this post. Think of the “I totally got that one right” glory I will obtain if I’m correct! *Half-Life: Alyx* is the one game I see everyone talking about coming to PS VR2, despite no rumors. It’s pure hope. Geoff has a rock solid relationship with Valve: He made the documentary on *Half-Life: Alyx*! If this port was going to exist, I feel like The Game Awards is the place to announce it.
