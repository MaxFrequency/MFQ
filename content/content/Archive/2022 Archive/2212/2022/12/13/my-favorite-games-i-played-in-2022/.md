I played a total of 28 games during 2022 and rolled credits on 22 of them.[^1] Itâ€™s 11 fewer games than in 2021, but a much higher completion percentage. The reality of it was that [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|chapterselect/]] kept me honest about beating games. I didnâ€™t venture far from our games for the show.

And honestlyâ€¦I like that. I never wondered what to play next. I always knew what Iâ€™d be working towards. I was mentally relieved from having to make a choice based on mood or genre. I just focused on sinking my teeth into the self-assigned selection. Itâ€™s like [Steve Jobs wearing the same outfit](https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/09/world/gallery/decision-fatigue-same-clothes/index.html) every day. I avoided [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) with my catalog of games.

There were some games I bought that I havenâ€™t played yet, despite wanting to. *The Last of Us Part I*, the *Cuphead* DLC, *Shredderâ€™s Revenge*, and *Stray* are some of the few. I havenâ€™t bought *Tunic* or *Inscryption* yet. I know Iâ€™ll get to these all some day. I find the winter to generally be a time to play whatever Iâ€™d like.

I wonâ€™t share the entire 2022 listâ€”thatâ€™d spoil Chapter Select Season 6â€”but I thought Iâ€™d share my favorites throughout the year. Here we go:
# *Metroid Dread*

I wrapped 2021 by starting *Dread* and finished it just a few days into the new year. A stellar game from top to bottom. Mercury Steam put forward such slick design. Samus has never been so fluid and dynamic.
# *The Great Ace Attorney Adventure*

This was a Christmas gift. I love the *Ace Attorney* series and was nervous about this new historical spin-off. I liked the idea of convincing a jury, but the cast (especially Herlock Sholmes) made me skeptical. I never should have doubted the fine folks at Capcom. I fell in love with the new crew (especially Herlock Sholmes) and the mysteries at hand. I am looking forward to tackling the packed-in sequel someday, perhaps during 2023.
# *Resident Evil 3*

This was before we decided that [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 5 - Resident Evil/chapterselect/season5/|Chapter Select Season 5]] would be all about Resident Evil. I needed a game to fill in a gap before the launch of..I honestly forget what I was waiting for, because *Resident Evil 3* is perfection. Not to spoil our upcoming episode on the game, but I absolutely love Jillâ€™s escape from Raccoon City. I even [uploaded my Inferno S Rank run while earning the Platinum](https://youtu.be/knaAFUTLuCk). Man, I canâ€™t wait to play again.
# *Grant Turismo 7*

I never thought Iâ€™d be into a SIM racer. I have always been an arcady racing gamer. But the State of Play sold me. *GT7* has such character. You feel the love poured into every polygon. You canâ€™t help but smile while playing.
# *Resident Evil 4 VR*

Again, I donâ€™t want to spoil our upcoming episode of Chapter Select. I did play this version after we decided to tackle the horror series. I selfishly wanted the VR version to be my first exposure to the iconic title. I added [the challenge of streaming the game in its entirety](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCxW3Sbhy5Z7jiYi0aoQAU0ZRIaBjNJR). It was a fun and creative layer, while exploring the beloved game.
# *God of War: RagnarÃ¶k*

*RagnarÃ¶k* is a game of two halves that were mashed together to try and make one game. Itâ€™s ambitious and bold. The dissonance between gameplay and story in the main game proves too great for Sony Santa Monicaâ€™s ambitions though. The final product is crammed into a state of disjointedness.

But dang, that combat is ðŸ”¥.
