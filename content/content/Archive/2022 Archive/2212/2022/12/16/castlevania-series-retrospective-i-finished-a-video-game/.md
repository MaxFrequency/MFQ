[Castlevania Series Retrospective – A Complete History and Review](https://youtu.be/peVgerhXJlU) by Matt for I Finished A Video Game on Youtube via [Aram Jabbari on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aramjabbari/status/1601942271070334977)

I don’t think I’ve ever recommended a 7+ hour video on YouTube, but holy water Ritcher, I can’t stop watching.

Wonderful narration, through research, rich context, and clean editing. I would love to know how Matt went about tackling such an ambitious video.
