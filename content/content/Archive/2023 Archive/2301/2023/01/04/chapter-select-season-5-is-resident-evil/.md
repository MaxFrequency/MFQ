For the season’s structure, Logan and I sat down and custom-tailored the order for Resident Evil. Given the nature of RE-makes, we wove in old and new together based off platform accessibility. Here is the order we have for Season 5:

I am fairly new to the *Resident Evil* franchise. I entered the fold with *RE7* because of PSVR. When *Village* hit shelves, I snagged it thanks to expiring credits at Best Buy. I never went beyond dabbling with the series classics, although I have longed for the iconic chainsaw GameCube controller.

In contrast, Logan is a long-time S.T.A.R.S agent, originally getting into the series all on the GameCube. He claims that *Resident Evil* is up there with *Metal Gear Solid*.

All of the art this season was generated by the DALL-E 2 AI art generator. We felt there was something eerily ironic about a corporate AI mashing together existing creations for us about a game series where an evil corporation makes zombie bioweapons. You know I’ll be digging in deep to the how to in this season’s [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 5 - Resident Evil/2023/07/27/behind-the-scenes-season-5/|Behind the Scenes]] post later this year.

It’s time for you to make a Jill Sandwich, put on your headphones, and pack up some green herbs for Season 5: *Resident Evil*! The first episode will be launching next Wednesday – January 11, 2023 – with new episodes following in a fortnightly manner. Subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts!
