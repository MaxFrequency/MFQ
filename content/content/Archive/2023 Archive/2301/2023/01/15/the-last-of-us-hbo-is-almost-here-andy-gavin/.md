[The Last of Us (HBO) is Almost Here](https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2023/01/14/the-last-of-us-hbo-is-almost-here/) by Andy Gavin

> I’m not going to spoil anything, but I just wanted to say that what I saw was pretty darn awesome — flawless really. Not that I’m unbiased, but the tone was a pitch-perfect match to the games. And, hey, the music was the same — which is incredibly important in forging an emotional tie in for fans.

I love that Andy Gavin was invited to the premiere. He and Jason may have left Naughty Dog almost 20 years ago, but they are still thought of as the company makes new things. I wonder if Jason was also in attendance (I would assume he was invited too).

The show is upon us. Only 8ish hours to go as of this writing. I am excited and nervous. Back when I did karate as a kid, before tests my sensei would say “being nervous just means you care.” I care about *The Last of Us*. I am curious about its implementation, removing the “[[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/05/chasing-the-stick/|on the stick]]” storytelling will be a fascinating hurdle to see the team tackle.
