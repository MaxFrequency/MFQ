[HBO’s The Last of Us has officially been renewed for a second season](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hbos-the-last-of-us-has-officially-been-renewed-for-a-second-season/) by Andy Robinson for Video Games Chronicle

Not surprising considering the [week-over-week growth](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hbo-claims-the-last-of-us-enjoyed-record-audience-growth-for-second-episode/), but I am happy to see it confirmed. So much of *Part II* hinges on gameplay doing the storytelling. I am curious how they will adapt the game for one(?) season of TV. That’s a lot of story, emotion, and range to cover in 10~ episodes.
