Last week’s Nintendo Direct was a solid one. [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2023/02/10/mfp-22/|Phil Summers and I talked it through on The Max Frequency Podcast]] last week, but I wanted to whip up a post about my favorite bounty hunter’s return. It feels good to get this long-standing rumor out into the open. Yet, it still felt surprising in some ways. The shadow drop the day of the Direct was the biggest of the bunch, with the physical release next week.

I was happy to see Retro at the helm. This is their first release since *Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze* for the Switch in 2018. It’s technically their first “new” game since Frozen Ape hit the Wii U in 2014; nearly a decade! Like I said on the show, someone has to tell the story of Retro Studios some day.

I was bummed to hear that the [original credits are not represented](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/original-metroid-prime-devs-criticise-remaster-for-omitting-credits/) in the game, leaving out that exceptional development team. It was also interesting to learn that there were [*nine* support studios](https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/62825/iron-galaxy-studios-assisted-with-metroid-prime-remastered-development) that worked on the remaster.[^1] Only two of them have updated their sites with the news that they worked on the game (Airship Interactive and Mineloader). A lot of these teams also worked on *Halo Infinite*, which speaks more to the state of that game than *Prime*. It’s no wonder this game leaked.

And of course, the best bit of coverage on the game is [Digital Foundry’s analysis](https://youtu.be/RnGZ82y-xi4). A beautiful showcase of the remastered assets and game performance. Interesting to see 900p be the resolution docked, but I am happy to hear that the framerate is stable. *Metroid Prime* has been stuck on the GameCube and Wii/Wii U for years now. With the digital version of the *Trilogy* going away, it’s nice to have the game brought forward into the modern era. I hope *Echoes* and *Corruption* get similar treatment, but the rumor mill says otherwise.
