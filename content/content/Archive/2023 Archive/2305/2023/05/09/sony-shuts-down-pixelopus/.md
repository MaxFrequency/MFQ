In this constant cycle of acquisitions, it’s not every day we see a first-party studio shut its doors. The last time Sony closed a first-party team was in 2021 with Japan Studio being reshuffled into Team Asobi. It’s unclear if the folks at PixelOpus are being reorganized throughout other teams or if everyone is just gone. Either way, my best wishes to all those affected.

Almost two years ago, PixelOpus [announced](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concrete-genie-studio-pixelopus-is-making-a-new-ps5-game-with-sony-pictures-animation/) a new wave of hiring for an Unreal Engine 5 project in partnership with Sony Pictures Animation. Seeing all of the TV shows and movies that are releasing this year, it’s easy to imagine that PixelOpus’ game was to be tied in with some sort of animated movie. *Concrete Genie* released just in 2019, so this new project had only been in the works for four years; and I suspect only really in serious development since that Unreal Engine 5 announcement two years ago.
