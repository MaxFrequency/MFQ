I could not believe the performance. A solid 30fps, outside of using the Ultrahand ability in busy areas. Nintendo knows their hardware inside and out. Crazy to think that the performance from previews had improved so rapidly with the day one patch.

I’m excited to dig into *Zelda*, someday soon. I have to finish this move and go to a wedding first. Sure, I could play portably, but I need to get cozy on the couch and play on the big screen.
