Ten years ago, my summer kicked off with a game that would change my life and countless others. Who knew a decade ago that I’d name [[../../../../../../2022 Archive/2209/2022/09/28/eloise-siobhan-roberts/|my daughter]] after Ellie.

I don’t have anything big planned for today. I should, but have just run out of time. I just wanted to acknowledge this significant milestone. 

If you’d like to see, read, or listen to any of my coverage on The Last of Us or Naughty Dog, check out [[../../../../../../../chasing-the-stick/|my hub for Chasing the Stick]]. The franchise is bigger than ever today with the TV show and [[../../../../../2301/2023/01/09/history-is-repeating-itself/|inevitable]] *Part III*. The multiplayer game is in [[../../../../../2305/2023/05/26/the-last-of-us-factions-multiplayer-delay/|limbo]], becoming [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/02/naughty-dog-dev-time-charts/|the studio’s longest developed game to date]].

*The Last of Us* has stood the test of time and will be around for many more years to come. Congratulations to Neil, Bruce, and the team at Naughty Dog. Endure and survive indeed.
