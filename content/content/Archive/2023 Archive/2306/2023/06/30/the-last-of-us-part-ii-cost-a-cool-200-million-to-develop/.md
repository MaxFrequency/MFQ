[Sony’s confidential PlayStation secrets just spilled because of a Sharpie](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/28/23777298/sony-ftc-microsoft-confidential-documents-marker-pen-scanner-oops) by Tom Warren and Sean Hollister for The Verge

> It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie — but when you scan them in, it’s easy to see some of the redactions. Oops.

I modified the image slightly, so I could read the text better.

Someone is in big trouble over in Sony’s legal department.

While the development time for The Last of Us Part II wasn’t a surprise, the cost to make it was. Now, $200 million also isn’t a surprise; massive AAA first-party exclusives fall in this range. Just look at Horizon Forbidden West in the previous sentence above.

For context though, *The Last of Us Part II* [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2006/2020/06/26/the-last-of-us-part-ii-4-million/|sold 4 million copies in three days]]. If all of those were just the base game at $59.99, Sony recouped the development cost and then some at $239,960,000. In 2022, the game reached [10 million copies sold](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/09/the-growing-future-of-the-last-of-us/), although the profit made is unknown due to discounted sales throughout that time. The entire series (four games) has sold [[../../../../../2301/2023/01/05/the-last-of-us-surpasses-37-million-in-sales/|37 million copies]].

I think the $200 million investment for *Part II* has paid off. I wager the investment in *[[../../../../../2301/2023/01/09/history-is-repeating-itself/|The Last of Us Part III]]* will pay off even more so; not sure if the [[../../../../../2305/2023/05/26/the-last-of-us-factions-multiplayer-delay/|multiplayer game]] will see the light of day though.
