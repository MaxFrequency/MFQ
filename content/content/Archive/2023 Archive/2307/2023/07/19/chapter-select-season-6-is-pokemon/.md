We want to be the very best; like no podcast ever was! It is time for us to catch them all as we tackle *Pokémon*. “Rivals” Max Roberts and Logan Moore set out on a grand adventure to collect, battle, and study this legendary series.

For the season’s structure, the classic bounce back-and-forth format of Chapter Select stands strong. We chose *Pokémon* generations as the backbone of the schedule. This allowed us to play the remakes where applicable. Here is the order we have for Season 6:

While I am no stranger to the brand of Pokémon, I am to most of these games. Before embarking on this journey, I had only played *Blue* and *Diamond*. Much like the protagonists at the start of the games, I have embarked on my very own Pokémon adventure filled with discovery.

As for my rival Logan, he’s been earning badges and becoming Champion since the [[../../../../../../../../../docs/assets/img/IMG_8601_edit.jpg|beginning]]. He’s played almost every mainline game before this season and is here to make sure I memorize the type chart.

These ten episodes are not all we have in store for Pokémon. [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|Super Chapter Select members]] have access to our Poké Battles in every single game. It’s a 10 round rivalry-fueled gauntlet to see who truly is the best. You can sign up for just [$20 a year](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=76115) for all these battles, longer shows, and exclusive episodes. You can learn more about Super Chapter Select [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|here]].

The art this season is taking the iconic *Pokémon* start screens and modifying them for the show. I’ve struggled coming up with this concept, but after playing around with fonts, colors, and console boarders, this is what we have chosen. As of this writing, I haven’t made most of the art yet, so I am excited to see where it goes!

We are thrilled to finally announce Season 6 – *Pokémon*! We’ve been working on this one for over a year. The first episode will be launching next month – August 23, 2023 – with new episodes following in a fortnightly manner. Subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts!
