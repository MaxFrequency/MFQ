Even though we moved three months ago now, I still feel like I am playing catch up.[^1] So much I want to write, film, record, and do. Well, now we can cross off my return to streaming.

This Thursday I’ll be tackling my dream GameCube build. Seems that during the move, my GameCube disc drive bit the dust.[^2] This discovery timed perfectly with the restock of the GC Loader, a optical disc emulator for the GameCube. So a bunch of kit and one business trip later, it’s time to put the whole thing together. This may be as close as I ever get to building my own PC.

I’ll be streaming this Thursday, August 17, 2023 at 7:00 PM EST. My plan is to not only install the GC Loader, but also swap shells with [[../../../../../../2020 Archive/2005/2020/05/05/spice-orange-gamecube-acquired/|my Japanese Spice Orange GameCube]], and plop in a brand new, quieter fan. 🤞🏻 it all goes well.
