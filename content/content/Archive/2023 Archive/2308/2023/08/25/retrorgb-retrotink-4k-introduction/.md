[Introducing the RetroTINK 4K](https://www.retrorgb.com/introducing-the-retrotink-4k.html) by Bob for RetroRGB

Here’s a [direct link to Bob’s video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=E3ep6sw0c8Y) as well.

> With the RetroTINK 4K coming out of an almost year-long private beta and now being publicly tested by some of the best people in retro, I felt it was time to do a proper introduction video. I tried to concentrate on things I felt I could add to the conversation, while also promoting upcoming videos from Digital Foundry, My Life In Gaming, GameSack and Wobbling Pixels; I figured I’d stick to what I’m good at and let them post great example footage.

I would like to buy a ticket for first class please.
