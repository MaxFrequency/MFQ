[[../../../../../../../../../docs/assets/img/3000years.jpg|Finally]].

Seems like I picked a real good time to try out the [[../../../../../2308/2023/08/22/streaming-paper-mario-ttyd-hero-mode/|Hero Mode]] mod on [[../../../../../2308/2023/08/31/thursday-night-stream-finishing-ttyd-hero-mode/|stream]]. And of course, my podcast [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/chapterselect/|chapterselect/]] has [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 1 - Paper Mario/chapterselect/season1/|everything Thousand-Year Door covered]]. Perhaps we will return to this remaster (remake?). God, I am so happy to see this world back.
