[Racing in Every Mario Kart Game Ever for Relay FM and St. Jude! - Switch | September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/MaXUeuSox1s)

Tomorrow night is the end cap to [my month-long stream to race on every track in the Mario Kart franchise](https://maxfrequency.net/2023/08/29/streaming-every-single-mario-kart-for-st-jude-and-relay-fm/) to help [raise money](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude) for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital alongside Relay FM. I’ve tackled everything from the [SNES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbUKrYBUUYs&t=11992s) to the [GameCube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHgc3z4ZZrA&t=21s) to the [3DS](https://youtube.com/live/fUZdAV7mDu0?feature=share). Soon it will be time to beat *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* from top to bottom; and this time, I won’t be entirely alone.  

My pal Casey Liss will be joining me around 8:00 PM EST for one cup. Casey is a host over at Relay on the show [Analog(ue)](https://www.relay.fm/analogue), he is one of the three hosts of the [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/), and he’s appeared on [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/MFP|MFP]] a [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2021/05/07/mfp-6/|couple]] of [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2022/09/14/mfp-17/|times]]. You can see Casey’s post about it [here](https://mastodon.social/@caseyliss/111138075033245679).  

I’m real eager to play alongside someone, even if it is just for one cup. The set will look a little different to accommodate this. It’s going to be a fun night of Mario Kart chaos and raising money for St. Jude. I hope you will stop by, hang out, and [donate](https://tiltify.com/@maxfrequency/mario-kart-st-jude)!
