[Halo Infinite Multiplayer – Spooky Season Stream | October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/au1Mnw5YgEI)

The boys wanted to play *Halo Infinite*, so I decided to stream it. I argue we are sticking with the spooky theme since *Infinite*‘s launch was scary. Heck, I’m sure my play style will be horrific to some of you too. It’s going to be a fun night.

I haven’t touched *Infinite* since the multiplayer launch two years ago. I never touched the campaign due to the lack of co-op at launch. Maybe I can convince the lads to play some SWAT. Is a SWAT playlist even a thing in *Infinite*? I guess I’ll find out. I’n not entirely sure when my friends will be able to hop on, so I may not start with *Halo* right away. No matter what, I’ll dabble around on the XSX and we will have some fun!

Come [swing by the stream](http://maxfrequency.live/) tonight at 8:00 PM EST to hang out with the boys and shoot some Spartans.
