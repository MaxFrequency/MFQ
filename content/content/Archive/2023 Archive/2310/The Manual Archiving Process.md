I'm back on an archival kick. I've switched writing applications from Craft to Obsidian. I've decided I want all my writing online backed up locally and in a manageable, readable file type like Markdown. 

So I'm back at the beginning, [10 years ago](https://maxfrequency.net/2023/05/18/10-year-anniversary/), to my blog Go Left Gaming, which I [merged](https://maxfrequency.net/2021/11/15/redesign-1/) here to Max Frequency back in 2021.

> Now, all my writing online is in one place. From my Guacamelee! review on May 18, 2013 to the latest episode of Chapter Select, it’s all here, dated properly, and searchable. I also saved what reviews and editorials I could from now-defunct sites like PS Insider and PlayStation Wire, dated those properly and added them to the site with links to their archive on the Wayback Machine (if it existed).

So far, I'm just through 2013. I've realized I had a very narrow perspective on the video game industry, but was trying to expand, like learning more about Xbox. I also linked a ton and used a buttload of images. 

IGN was my main source for *everything*, which makes sense. I wanted to work there and was using Go Left Gaming to build up a résumé.
