Marc "Try4ce" Duddleson has published his [HDMI deep dive](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SMkimgEwWXs) on the RetroTINK 4K. It's an absolute blast to see just how deep Try goes, especially after [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/The Max Frequency Podcast/2023/08/30/mfp-30/|talking to him]] about this very video three months ago.

Toward the end of the video, Try shows off his cable routing for his entire HDMI-based set up and it is *truly* a sight to behold.

While examining the flow, I started thinking about just how many HDMI cables this setup requires. So I decided to count them.

Starting on the left, Try is using three five-port HDMI 2.0 switchers. I appreciate the theming of each, with the HDMI-modded retro consoles on one, one for the eighth gen consoles, and the last being for the Switch and Analogue consoles. These tally up to 18 HDMI cables.

I wonder why the HDMI-modded consoles go into an audio extractor, but from that device those consoles feed into a glorious 16-port HDMI switcher. That switcher is home to 10 consoles ranging from the [[../../../../../2308/2023/08/21/hot-fresh-homebrewed-consoles/|Wii U]] to the [[../../../../../../2021 Archive/2103/2021/03/27/mister-review/|MiSTer FPGA]]. All of these switchers feed into Try's HDMI 2.1 AV receiver. Add in 13 more cables.

There are two more switchers, but only one of them is for the hottest new consoles, the PS5 and XSX. This HDMI 2.1 switch feeds into a 2.1 splitter, which goes into that Denon receiver. I'll circle back to last switcher later. Five more cables to the list.

The Denon is the brain of the operation. One of the out cables goes directly to Try's LG C1 OLED. Another goes to the RetroTINK 4K and the Zone 2 Out feeds back into the HDMI 2.1 switcher (I already counted that cable). The TINK goes into another HDMI 2.1 splitter, one out to the TV and one over to Try's capture PC. Another five to the web of cables.

The PC has both a HDMI 2.0 and 2.1 capture card. The PS5 and XSX chain feeds into the 2.1 card, while the TINK goes into the 2.0 card. Both of these cards feed right into the last 2.0 switch and that feeds out into a Atmos Ninja V. 

And that's the entire chain. Like I said, it is something to behold. I am already taking notes and ideas for [[../../../../../2309/2023/09/13/game-room-studio-tour-2023/|my own setup]]. But how many cables is Try using to wire all this up? Drum roll please...

45 HDMI cables. I wager at least 12 of them are 2.1 spec.

I'd love to see it all laid out behind his TV. ðŸ˜¬ 

I can't wait to get my own RetroTINK 4K soon. It seems to be the dream scaler.
