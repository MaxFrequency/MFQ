Hello everybody! Back in July, Logan and I [[../../../../../2307/announcing-super-chapter-select|announced Super Chapter Select]]. It's a member-supported tier of the show with longer shows, exclusive episodes, and bonus videos. As we wind down [[../../../../../../../Podcasts/Chapter Select/Season 6 - Pokémon/chapterselect/season6/|Season 6 – Pokémon]] here, we decided to release a special from each season during these interstitial weeks.

For our final week before the Season 6 finale, we’re sharing the beginning of our 10+ round *Pokémon* Battle series. This has been my absolute favorite series we’ve made. I could not have scripted a better run. I hope you enjoy the tournament.

The original plan was just to do the online supported games, which is six games spanning the 3DS and Switch. After we happened to be together for *FireRed/LeafGreen* and *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, I knew we could make all ten work. We just recorded our *Black/White* battle in person during our annual Game Awards get together and with the help of fan servers, we’ll wrap up the full run.

I said “10+” above because over the course of the season, Logan came up with the idea for an ultimate battle were we trade-up our top/favorite *Pokémon* across all the games to *Scarlet/Violet* and duke it out in ultimate style. We may even use the power of NSO for a battle or two, if we fancy.

If you'd like to see everything we have to offer, you can sign up for Super Chapter Select right now! It is only [$2.50 per month](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=99142) or [$20 a year](https://maxfrequency.memberful.com/checkout?plan=76115)! You'll get access to nearly 30 hours of member-exclusive material across almost all our seasons.
