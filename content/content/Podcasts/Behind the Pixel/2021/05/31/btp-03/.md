> Part of creating *The Max Frequency Podcast* was to restore all the episodes of *Behind the Pixel*, an interview show I did in 2017 for seven episodes. These will be mixed into this feed so that the show can live on podcast services once more. Below are the original show notes, with some light editing. I hope you enjoy.

This time on Behind the Pixel, I talk to Nick “Woz” Wozniak and Ian Flood from Yacht Club Games: The studio behind one of my favorite games of all time–*Shovel Knight*. Join me as I dig into the early days of their Kickstarter, their on-going stretch goals, and the future of the studio. Listen in to learn all about the crowd funded success and its community centered studio.

> “We believe in *Shovel Knight*. We know that the final game is going to be great. We’re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We’ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it’s not enough to finish the game. In order to make *Shovel Knight* a reality, we need you!” – Yacht Club Games from their [Kickstarter for *Shovel Knight*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yachtclubgames/shovel-knight/description)
