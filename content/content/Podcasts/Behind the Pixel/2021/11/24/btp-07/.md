> Part of creating *The Max Frequency Podcast* was to restore all the episodes of *Behind the Pixel*, an interview show I did in 2017 for seven episodes. These will be mixed into this feed so that the show can live on podcast services once more. Below are the original show notes, with some light editing. I hope you enjoy.

The worlds of hip-hop and video collide, not in the world of DJ Hero, but in the artistic stylings of Roger Pokorny. Through his spunky video essays, Roger takes the energy and vibrancy of hip-hop to talk about pop culture and games. From unique perspectives such as the state of rebooting franchises to the insanity of defending *Arkham Origins*, Roger’s infectious spirit and style rubs off on all his viewers.
