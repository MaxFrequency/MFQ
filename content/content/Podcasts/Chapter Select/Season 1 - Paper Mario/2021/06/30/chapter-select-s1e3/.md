It feels like it has been 1,000 years since *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door* came out for the Nintendo GameCube; mostly because there hasn’t been a game like it since. Max, Logan, and special guest Scott White return to the seedy town of Rogueport to see if *The Thousand-Year Door* is a grand, epic stage production or a sloppy side show in the series.
