Season 8 will be all about *Castlevania*.
# [[../Season 7 - Metroid Prime/chapterselect/season7/|Season 7 - Metroid Prime]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S7 Placeholder Art.jpg|S7 Placeholder Art.jpg]]

Season 7 will be all about *Metroid Prime*.
# [[../Season 6 - Pokémon/chapterselect/season6/|Season 6 - Pokémon]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S6 Art.jpg|S6 Art.jpg]]

We want to be the very best; like no podcast ever was! Welcome to Season 6 of Chapter Select! It is time for us to catch them all as we tackle *Pokémon*. “Rivals” Max Roberts and Logan Moore set out on a grand adventure to collect, battle, and study this legendary series.
# [[../Season 5 - Resident Evil/chapterselect/season5/|Season 5 - Resident Evil]]

Welcome to Season 5 of Chapter Select! Logan Moore brings Max Roberts under Capcom’s horror umbrella and guides him through this nightmarish franchise. Clear out your inventory. Turn off the lights. It’s time for…*Resident Evil*!
# [[../Season 4 - The Fast and the Furious/chapterselect/season4/|Season 4 - The Fast & The Furious]]

Logan has never been a part of the Fast Family, while Max has been riding with the crew since the Miami days. Grab a Corona, order a tuna fish sandwich, and buckle up as we explore this legendary series.
# [[../Season 3 - Banjo-Kazooie/chapterselect/season3/|Season 3 - Banjo-Kazooie]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S3 Art.jpg|S3 Art.jpg]]

*Banjo-Kazooie* is a unique series with so few entries. From the warm, fuzzy glow of the N64 to the crispness of XSX, Season 3 aims to figure out if Banjo-Threeie needs to be made or if fans are just cuckoo.
# [[../Season 2 - God of War/chapterselect/season2/|Season 2 - God of War]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S2 Art.jpg|S2 Art.jpg]]

*God of Wa*r is one of PlayStation Studios’ strongest series. Before *Ragnarök*, Season 2 goes back to see how Kratos has (and hasn’t) changed over the last 15 years.
# [[../Season 1 - Paper Mario/chapterselect/season1/|Season 1 - Paper Mario]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S1 Art.jpg|S1 Art.jpg]]

Thanks to the power of the Wii U, Season 1 is all about Nintendo’s paper-stylized RPG series that has changed dramatically over the past 20 years.
# [[../Season 0 - The Last of Us/chapterselect/season0/|Season 0 - The Last of Us]]

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/S0 Art.jpg|S0 Art.jpg]]

Hot off the heels of *The Last of Us Part II*, Max and Logan decided to test Chapter Select’s format with Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic series.
