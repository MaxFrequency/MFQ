# Show Description

Logan is out of town this weekend, so with the host away, Max takes the reigns with Brian Henken! They discuss the *Battlefront* beta/*Star Wars* feels, *Shovel Knight*‘s physical edition dilemma, *Half-Life 3* text files, and making devilish levels in *Mario Maker* for charity.

For the glorious remainder of the show, Max and Brian duke it out verbally and list the *Kingdom Hearts* franchise from the worst to the best. Wounds are reopened, friendships broken, darkness embraced, and musical numbers sang. Let us know what you top *Kingdom Hearts* games are by contacting us with the info below!
