# Show Description

As Halloween approaches, a spooky aura takes over the show. With a officially licensed *Friday the 13th* game announced on Kickstarter, Logan and Max discuss the game’s concept and plan. Also in the show’s news segment, *Arkham Knight*‘s DLC has been fully laid out, which leads Max to rant. *Zelda* and NX rumors stir the Nintendo fan in both hosts. For the topic half of the show, Logan and Max reminisce on their favorite horror and Halloween themed games. Max also wants a major genre to make a gaming comeback all thanks to a movie trailer.
