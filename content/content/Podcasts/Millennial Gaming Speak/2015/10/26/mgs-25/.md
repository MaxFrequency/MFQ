# Show Description

Playstation is aiming to take the spotlight for the next week with their big press conference at Paris Games Week on Tuesday, October 27, 2015 at 1 p.m. EST. Logan and Max speculate what they will show off and what they will save for PSX in December.

Logan and Max also discuss conventional games that are pushed forward with a twist. Can a VR “on rails first person shooter” experience work for *Until Dawn*‘s potential DLC? How will *Zelda* put a spin on open world games?

The hosts close out the show by celebrating the PS2’s 15 birthday (October 26, 2015)with their favorite PS2 games and chatting about how good at story telling TellTale has gotten.
