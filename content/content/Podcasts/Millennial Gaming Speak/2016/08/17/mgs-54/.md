# Show Description

This week Max and Logan are joined by TWO guests, Michael Ruiz and Brian Henken. The fearsome foursome try to speculate what we will see in September at Sony’s recently announced, PlayStation Meeting as well as discussing the recent *Final Fantasy 15* delay to November. Later, they give their early thoughts on *No Man’s Sky* and discuss whether or not getting too excited for a game can ruin it for you once it has finally released.

Follow Max and Logan on Twitter!
