# Show Description

It’s the episode everyone has been waiting for — the all Logan special! This week Logan is joined by Logan Wilkinson from Irrational Passions to talk about the state of gaming journalism along with discussing Logan’s new podcast called Input. After some one off conversations about baseball and Bioshock, Logan and Logan talk about games they’ve been playing lately which include Yakuza Kiwami and Pyre. It’s a more laid back show this week but one that we hope you love regardless.
