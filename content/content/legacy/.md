> [!info] Update (2/7/22) 
> The new, fully searchable archive is available; just use the search bar. It includes all those reviews and features previously listed below. I have kept the list of wiki guides in place though.

Here is an archive of my wiki guide work for IGN. I’ve never put all my published work in one place. I decided to remedy that with Max Frequency. Each guide entry details the platform, the game’s release date, and the focus of my work.

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/maxfrequency) with various types of content.
